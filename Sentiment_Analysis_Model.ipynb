Today's situation has driven us crazy, I want add dog to fly but nobody not help with this. Them unswear just we can’t helps. So what you can ?I’ll explain the situation: on May 19, in Paris, the day before our flight to Oslo, we needed to register our dog for a Norwegian flight. For this we called your company, since we bought tickets there. We have done this procedure more than once since we often fly with a dog, and we know how this is done and where we should call to have our dog included in the ticket. but your employees began to claim that they were not able to do this, and that we would contact Norwegian airlines. At Norwegian we were told that your company must open the entrance to the gate in ticket so that we put in system dog 🤯 We wasted 1.5 hours of our time on these useless calls. Why did something that should be done in 10 minutes take so much time and without results? after we spent an hour persuading your employee to give the phone to a person who is higher than him (for example, a manager), your manager said that we have to pay 250 € for this service (when normally it costs a maximum of 100 €) BUT HE DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT OUR DOG WILL BE ADDED ON THE TICKET. and I want to ask a question, what should I pay for then if you don’t even give guarantees? Our problem was never resolved, we were forced to go to the airport, wasting our time on something that your employees could not do over the phone.And in the future I advise you to hire people who know how to do their job, and not those who make fools of clients. | Rating: 1\n",

            "Page 170: Reason for complaint: invalidity of the 4 tickets at check-in, attributable to gotogate.fr.Flight: Basel -->frankfurt --> BEIJING --> GUANGZHOUTo explain, I arrived at Basel Mulhouse airport at 6 a.m., before the scheduled departure time of 11:15 a.m. , along with three other passengers. However, the agent at the airport check-in desk informed us that the four passengers, including me, were unable to check in or board the plane due to a problem with their tickets. This problem could not be resolved on the spot, as we were told that an error had been made in issuing the tickets with Air China, for which your department was responsible. We were perfectly prepared to undertake the trip, with valid passports, proof of exit (for air and rail), and luggage that complied with size and weight requirements.As a result, the four passengers mentioned were prevented from boarding the plane on the planned date. That same day, I spent over 10 hours on the phone with your customer service department trying to resolve the problem. This resulted in an additional charge on my phone bill to contact Air China. Despite my efforts, no satisfactory solution was found by your customer service department. At my own expense, I had to make changes to the tickets, for more than 3000€, in order to obtain four new one-way tickets.However, even after purchasing new tickets from your customer service department, we continued to experience problems. I was forced to stay at the airport overnight in order to keep up to date with the airport service.Here are the problems encountered during check-in the next day with new tickets:- Passenger 1: no ticket issued for this person- Passenger 2: no ticket issued for this person- Passenger 3: ticket with error- Passenger 4: this person has a ticket, but his name appears 2 times on the tickets (his ticket and that of passenger 3) when checking in at the airport.We had to contact Air China in China to solve the problem. However, each time we tried, Air China's customer service department informed us that a malfunction had occurred, attributable to your department's poor processing of airline tickets. After 5 hours of phone calls with your customer service department and Air China's, we were able to find a temporary solution with the tickets provided by GoToGate.However, to my astonishment and displeasure, on landing in Frankfurt, I discovered that Passenger 1's ticket was limited to Frankfurt and did not include the journey to Guangzhou. Similarly, Passenger 2 was unable to fly from Frankfurt to Beijing. Furthermore, Frankfurt airport staff informed us that the Beijing-Guangzhou flight was also incorrect, as it took place on 16/04/2024 at 05:15 (local time) instead of 17/04/2024 at 05:15 (local time). We were forced to buy new tickets from Air China for more than 800€ per ticket. I am outraged and consider this situation to be totally unacceptable in terms of the service provided.In addition, we had to spend the night on the ground in the airport for lack of transport and hotel reservations for the night. The moral and financial damage is considerable. Our professional schedule in China has been totally disrupted, and we have missed some of the trade shows we had planned to visit.I am deeply disappointed with the level of service provided by GoToGate and hope for a fair resolution to compensate for the inconvenience caused. I urge GoToGate to address these issues promptly and take responsibility for the disruptions caused to their customers. In the event of a compensation, I will be able to change my mind. | Rating: 1\n",

            "Page 178: I am adding to a review I left earlier this year as I have just discovered some extra information that I was not aware of. After GoToGate had unilaterally tried to cancel our flight home from New Zealand, without offering us any alternative (which they could quite simply have done) I ended up making lots of calls to them to try and sort it out. These calls were from Australia and NZ, but to what looked like a London number (although clearly none of the staff were in London but were somewhere in South Asia). They consistently refused to call me back or to provide an alternative way of getting in touch - WhatsApp, Zoom, Skype etc - that would have reduced the number of international phone calls I was having to make. I have just discovered what my phone bill was - and it is utterly shocking. It was hundreds of UK £s. I can't possibly have run up a bill that big without the phone number being a premium rate line - of which there is absolutely no warning. It's just one more sign of their utterly rubbish customer service and it just adds to the feeling that this is a very sketchy company. It might be fine if nothing goes wrong - but as soon as it does, you are in trouble. | Rating: 1\n",

My friend was not able to travel. Cebu Pacific promptly refunded the full amount, including baggage, to booking.com and/or gotogate.com.My issues:1. Booking.com and/or gotogate.com did not inform me that a refund had been processed. I suspect they would have gladly kept all of the money for themselves. It was only six weeks later, when I queried Cebu Pacific, that I found out that the refund had been sent to booking.com and/or gotogate.com.2. When I requested the refund from booking.com (and their contractors, gotogate.com), they only gave me a part-refund, claiming that the prepaid baggage was non-refundable -- even though Cebu Pacific confirmed to me that the full amount (including baggage) is definitely refundable, and confirmation that Cebu Pacific had already refunded the full amount (including baggage).That makes booking.com and gotogate.com liars and thieves. | Rating: 1\n",

            "Page 178: Despite meticulously proofreading all names and details, a simple typo in the last names of two passengers slipped through, only to be discovered when confirmation emails arrived. Not only was I expected to pay for their error, but I also felt a complete lack of willingness to accommodate my request, despite my loyalty as a customer and willingness to meet them halfway by paying an airline admin charge.Instead of promptly rectifying the mistake, I received a call informing me of additional fees required for the correction. Their solution? I was instructed to upload passport copies to facilitate the necessary changes. However, what followed was even more infuriating.This, despite the fact that the error stemmed from their own oversight. I requested the agent to reconsider these charges, as it's patently unfair to burden the customer for this. Yet I was willing to meet them halfway and negotiate To add insult to injury, I was told that an email would be sent explaining how I could raise a complaint against this issueg. However, to date, no such email has materialized. It seems that GOTOGATE  not only failed to resolve the issue but has also completely ignored my concerns and shown a lack of empathy towards customers.It's disheartening to witness a company prioritize penny-pinching over genuine customer satisfaction. Not only was I expected to pay for their error, but I also felt a complete lack of willingness to accommodate my request, despite my loyalty as a customer and willingness to meet them halfway by paying an airline admin charge.Save yourself the frustration and choose an airline that values its customers' satisfaction over squeezing every last penny out of them.I know writing this review won't solve my issue as the attitude suggests of the company (ignore and move on, this is not their headache stance) but at least it will warn others of potential such reoccurrence.I have been waiting for several days to hear back from Gotogate regarding a typo issue, but I have not received any response yet. During my last call with their advisor, they assured me that everything would be sent to me via email. However, I have not received any communication from them. It is evident that Gotogate is more concerned about avoiding negative reviews rather than resolving customer issues. It is disappointing to see where their priorities lie. | Rating: 1\n",

Something went wrong from when I booked and I got my flight info.  NO ONE flies into Croatia and then takes a return flight an hour later.  It is obvious something went wrong and I can't get any help to fix this matter.  I shouldn't have to pay the 100 euro change fee for something that I didn't do.  I just want my flights to be correct.  Looks like I will be forced to pay for the correct date since there is no customer service that can help a customer.  The 3 people I have spoken too have been polite but all they could do is repeat that the case has been escalated and that the 'supervisors', who only work M-F, are busy because of Iran/Israel flight cancellations.  I understand that is important but I think my issue deserves better than waiting 4 days (so far) for a resolution.  If the customer service people can't help us, then what is their purpose.    **update**. As you can see from the reply, there is no help being provided and I have been told that the mistake is all mine. Great.

Things seemed good, the airfares seemed to good to be true (because they were!) $1860 for international flights from Aus to Jap, Can and back to Aus.

I didn't notice at the time that the booking.c0m/gotogate system used my \"display name\" for my booking name.

I discovered this about a month later and contacted booking.c0m/gotogate to get this rectified ASAP, my trip was in 19 days so I needed it done with some urgency! I got a response email: \"Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your request to correct the name on your reservation. We understand the importance of having accurate information, and we apologize for any inconvenience caused.\"They asked for my passport details and mentioned it would be take roughly 72 hours to correct their mistake.16 days later!

            "Page 182: Completely Unregulated FraudMy partner and I booked flights to and from Cuba through Gotogate. We spent the additional money to guarantee additional legroom for the flights where we were able to book through the Gotogate system (the long-haul leg outbound was only able to be booked through Iberia directly- by the time I worked this out with no help from Gotogate who just said they couldn't book that leg, it was too late for extra leg room but as it was a daytime leg, my partner and I agreed this was low risk). We both double checked the seating and were happy to go ahead. The reason for this (particularly on the return leg) is that, in addition to being 6'4\" tall, my partner has epilepsy and one of their triggers for seizures is a lack of sleep. The return flight from Havana was overnight so it was imperative that we make sure they were as comfortable as possible to get as much sleep as possible. When we boarded the flight, we aimed for the mid-rear bulkhead as that was where the seats on the seatplan we had booked from were located, only to find that they were in fact standard legroom, mid-aircraft seats and absolutely nowhere near where we had expected them to be. As the flight was full, the aircrew were not able to move my partner to an extra legroom seat and so neither of us slept. When we boarded the short haul flight from Madrid to London, we found that our anticipated overwing exit row seats were actually, again, standard legroom (gallingly, one row behind the extra legroom row).When I complained to Gotogate through their chat function, they accused me of making the error despite the fact that it was for medical grounds and, frankly, I wouldn't be so stupid (no-one wants to be in the air for eight hours wondering if their partner is going to have a fit just to save a few ££). When I queried this and stated that they had put my partner in danger, I was told it was to do with the airline and that, unless I could provide screenshots of the seating plan I booked from months previously, they couldn't do anything. I then requested that they send me the seating chart and price plan that was being used and valid at the time of my booking. They refused. When I stated that if they could not provide evidence that it was me that had made the mistake then they owed me a refund, the agent closed the chat (on this occasion, I have screenshotted the whole convesation). Having investigated, it is clear that Gotogate is completely unregulated and so I'll be reaching out to the office of fair trading in order to obtain refunds for the seats at the very least. I didn't anticipate spending the whole journey home from a wonderful holiday in tears because of a scam booking agency but here we are. | Rating: 1\n",

I foolishly trusted them and initially agreed for them to chase the refund. Despite months of chasing and hours of phoning them it was only July 2023 they got through to the refund team of the airline and requested it. The airline refused the refund stating it was down to 'customers choice' - of course was not and should have been disputed by Go to Gate as they had all the evidence and were the ones to have told me the airline cancelled it. Did they email me or call me with this update? No they updated it on my original booking on the go to gate website which of course I never go on or needed to anymore or communicated with them about it. Now chasing up they tell me the airline says too much time has gone. They did not advocate for me, I had to spend hours begging them to do so, when they did they did it wrong and because of their error I now don't get my money back. Do go to gate have it? Do the airline? When I quite understandably got upset and appealed to the go to gate staff who told me it had gone on for too long and I had to go to airline myself (they already told me I can only go through go to gate) he hung up on me. Fantastic. Enjoy your sad little life Go to Gate! I've just received an email from the person who hung up and stated 'we have been told you want to reschedule your booking' so clearly they haven't read or understood any of my situation and didn't listen/understand anything I told them over the phone - once again, please don't book with them!!I'm lucky I'm not dependent on it or hadn't been saving up for that once in a life time trip and had other means.

I'm supposed to fly in a week and as of now have no way of getting home. The worst!!!! Better to spend more and book with the airline directly. They make their money by cheating people out of their hard earned money. STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!! Update: After many useless and frustrating chats with gotogate they offered a full refund since they couldn't get me home. I ended up booking directly with the airline for double what I paid gotogate. But at this point it was last minute and I was happy to have something confirmed. If I had booked directly with the airline originally it would have cost me less (more than gotogate but less than I ended up paying). Let's see how long it takes me to get my refund.

            "Page 186: i wish there was an option for zero star. We booked return flights for 4 people via gotogate, and then the airlines switched the times. We called gotogate to cancel, were assured it would happen within the week and no mention of any fees. 10 days later, when we call up to see what was happening - they told us that there would be be fees from the airline - $160 per person, per way - coming to $1280, not counting their own fees of $360. I was horrified by this - especially when i called the airline directly, and was told that when the airlines adjust the flighttimes significantly, it can be cancelled for free, but that it would have to be done via gotogate. I called back gotogate who assured me a callback within 24 hours - 10 days and i'm still waiting. You can't get through to anyone who can actually help you. My flights are coming up in 2 weeks and I've yet to hear anything. AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!!Edit: The answer from GotoGate is unbelievable. I am am TRYING to request a full refund from your agents, which according to the airline should be free - and the answer I got - after 3 weeks - was that it would cost $1,600 for this! THAT is the point of my review. After escalating the request and being promised a callback in 24 hours - it's been two weeks and nothing, whilst the flight dates are coming up and we have not been able to make other arrangements as they keep ignoring us.  And they have the cheek to answer publicly whilst ignoring the point entirely. This company is awful, I think their policy must be to ignore these in the hopes that we'll eventually give up and go away. Honestly, the amount of aggravation and time spent on the phone to customer service agents who refuse to help me is beyond compensation at this point. | Rating: 1\n",

Unfortunately, my experience with them has been nothing short of disappointing.The first red flag arose when I noticed that they had misspelled my name on the ticket. Despite contacting their customer service multiple times to rectify this error, they failed to provide a satisfactory solution. This oversight caused unnecessary stress and uncertainty about whether I would encounter issues during check-in and boarding.To compound matters, when I requested a refund due to their mistake and the ensuing inconvenience, Gogo Gate displayed a complete lack of empathy and accountability. They refused to provide me with the credits I rightfully deserved, leaving me out of pocket and deeply dissatisfied with their service.Overall, my experience with Gogo Gate has been marred by incompetence and a disregard for customer satisfaction.

Yet, upon selecting the payment option, I was confronted with a sudden and unwelcome surprise - a pop-up notification informing me of a price increase, approximately 20% higher than originally advertised.This unexpected hike not only wasted a substantial amount of my time but also felt like a deceptive practice, leading to a loss of trust in Gotogate.

I then receive an email from them saying they were unable to change my flight and a refund would be issued within two weeks. Two weeks had passed, no refund. Which was strange because the last cancellation I had was with the same airline and I got that refund in two days, but nothing with this one. So I called them, they said I needed to wait maybe another week. Waited another week - NO REFUND! So I called and they said they were waiting on the airline. I said well can you refund me my $506 extra I paid for new flights that you could process. Sure - refund was in my account within two days. However still no refund from original flight. It’s now mid March and I have rang almost every week if not two weeks to ask what the hell is going on. Assured everytime my request is being escalated blah blah blah.

Because of health reason, I would like to update my mother's tickets to open tickets (an open-status ticket type at Turkish airline, which will charge 200 dollars later for rescheduling and of course need to plus fare difference if any). The agency said that the tickets that i have are already open tickets and i can wait until later after the departure date to reschedule. Then, I felt strange (if i miss the flight then it will be my own fault right, logically?). Then i decided to call the airline for verification. The Turkish airline told me that what the agency said was NOT true - my tickets are still \"up-coming tickets\" not \"open tickets\", and it is likely that the agency just wanted to cheat more money, because: (1) first, no-show on the departure flight - charge 400 dollars, (2) then, reschedule a new flight - charge 200 dollars. What is worse, often, when you will decide the new date and call them for reschedule / issue new tickets, the agency TOGOGATE will say that they cannot find your ticket any more in the system because that you have miss the original flight. So, you will lose all the money! Oh, that sounds very dangerous - then i decided to cancel the flight, because that I do not trust the agency any more. So i started asking how to do cancellation instead. Then, the agency told me different fees to pay - even the same service person on the phone told me three different sums / amount of fees just within 30 minutes. I was told that I cannot cancel the flight tickets myself or cancel it with the airline. By then, i had spent 2 hours on this back and forth. Too impossible to stand... So i decided to cancel the flights, with whatever fee that they wanted to charge. In the end, the cancellation cost me 900 dollars for my parents' two tickets. I asked the agency phone service for an email confirmation regarding this, because of zero trust on them now. They said that they sent to me twice, but i got only once. If i did not insist on seeing the email confirmation before hanging up the phone call, i do not know what would happen later. We will need to see what will happen to the refund later. Will update here as soon as i know.To sum up, I have been flying internationally with different airlines and various agencies for 20 years.

            "Page 192: Outrageous & unacceptable behaviour by GotoGateMy order number: MLCQ9SI am expressing my utter dismay and outrage at the outrageous and utterly disgusting behaviour exhibited by GOTOGATE in handling my case as a disabled passenger. Despite my repeated attempts to resolve the matter, I have been met with nothing but ignorance and negligence.I provided a cancellation notice for my order number MLCQ9S on December 16th of last year due to my wife's denial of boarding caused by a transit visa confusion. Despite this, GOTOGATE has continuously ignored my pleas for assistance. Their response, dated December 24th, 2023, was nothing short of inadequate and dismissive.GOTOGATE initially agreed to refund the return tickets, only to later backtrack on their promise and shift the responsibility onto WhizzAir and Saudi Airlines. However, both airlines have unequivocally stated that the refund must be processed through GOTOGATE, contrary to GOTOGATE's claims.I have tirelessly called and emailed both airlines, only to be met with frustration and dead ends. GOTOGATE, in a blatant display of irresponsibility, has washed their hands of the matter, despite being fully aware that the refund must be paid through them.This unacceptable behavior has caused immense stress and financial strain on me and my family. As a disabled person, I rely on the integrity and efficiency of service providers like GOTOGATE to ensure my travel arrangements are handled with the utmost care and professionalism. However, their actions have demonstrated a complete lack of respect and disregard for my rights as a passenger.I demand immediate action to rectify this situation. GOTOGATE must honor their commitment to refund the tickets as promised and provide compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused. Failure to do so will result in further escalation of this matter to the relevant authorities and regulatory bodies.I expect a prompt and satisfactory resolution to this matter. Anything less would be a clear indication of GOTOGATE's disregard for the well-being of their customers, particularly those with disabilities.Sincerely,Abdul Kalam | Rating: 1\n",

            "Page 193: I do not recommend to book through Gotogate and I won't do it anymore. I have booked my trips multiple times through Gotogate, but today I got a message of the cancellation of the first flight on my trip.First time I contacted the chat of Gotogate I got only one option to rebook the flight, by delaying 1 full day the departure, and duplicating the stopovers and the total duration of the flight. i asked if there were flights before the planned departure. I was flexible with up to 4 days earlier. The response is that they checked and there were no options. Obviously I declined their proposal and I did my own search with the airline. I found multiple options for the same flight as original ( or very similar with less than 30 minutes difference) for the 3 previous days. I contacted again the customer service via their chat function. This time the agent gave me the option to flight the next day, exactly same flight (so only 1 stopover instead of 2 proposed earlier) and half the duration of previous option. I informed the agent beforehand that there were options for the days before but the agent offered only the option to flight the day after which was not convenient for me. The agent wanted to charge me a fee to check other flights before the date. I found this very shady. The fee is not reimbursable if the airlines declines the rebooking. Therefore, I don't recommend to book throught Gotogate, because if there is an issue, they see an opportunity to get more money from you. At the end what seems cheap, might become more expensive. Note the difference in prices today is not that much, so it is worth to go for the airline directly. Less headache and less waste of time. | Rating: 1\n",

They wouldn't notify you if your flight is cancelled by the airline and I had the luck of finding myself by chance - then paying a fortune for new tickets as it was last minute booking. I won't use again even if price is a bit cheaper- not worth it. Edit: FYI refund of the small amount was issued from the airline itself. But obviously because I was not informed of cancellation until last minute I paid tripple the price for new ticket. Just so people don't look at the reply and think it's a good company.

However, the fees charged appear to be only to request they be seated together. When I go to Etihad I have to pay hundreds more to identify the preferred seat. I sincerely see the fee for having them seated together as a rip off as I could have requested at no cost directly with the airlines.  The flight times have also changed by many hours with 8 hrs lay over (was 2) and 5 hour layover (was one). I had no communication from the travel agency GotoGate in regard to these changes and only noticed when I went directly to the Etihad website.

            "Page 195: This platform and service is absolutely horrible. I booked a trip through gotogate and 5 hours later wanted to cancel it because something came up. Not even 12 hours went by and the customer service had no idea how to assist me. They only provide a cellphone number, no email address or text message in order to speak to the service. The customer service told me after 5 times of calling them that I needed to directly contact the different airlines because they don't have access to the site. Yet, as I tried doing this, the direct airlines would not speak to me because I booked through gotogate. Therefore, this platform is absolutely useless- they don't even try assisting you and push you over to the airlines directly which actually can't even speak to you if you didn't directly book through them. On top of this, keeping in mind I wanted to cancel only 5 hours after having made the booking, they will not even cancel my trip, and give me a refund. I attempted writing several emails to gotogate, and also attempted calling several times and have received no response. This customer service and platform is ridiculous and will steal your money by pushing you over and giving you solutions that are not valid. So disappointed and shocked by the level of disrespect of money and of its customers. I expect to get a full refund and the company is absolutely unreachable, while the people on the phone have no clue how to help me. | Rating: 1\n",

            "Page 198: On September 5, 2023, I bought a multi-destination ticket with Gotogate travel agency for the Dubai-Jeddah (15/10/2023) and Riyadh-Dubai (22/10/2023) routes.This is a tourist trip. During the purchase process, on the Gotogate website, there was no reference to a flight or flights specifically dedicated to a religious pilgrimage. The same was true of the confirmation email from Gotogate.The cost of the ticket was 389.99 GBP which was paid with my card for a total cost of 470.25 EUR.On October 13, 2023, I received an email from the airline operating the flights (Fly Dubai) informing me that the Dubai-Jeddah flight was a specific flight reserved for pilgrims with \"Umrah\" visas or GCC citizens only, which I therefore could not take.On October 13, 2023, I called Gotogate customer service to complain about this unacceptable situation. Gotogate had sold me, without any prior information, a Dubai-Jeddah ticket requiring a specific religious visa. This is not the case for standard Dubai-Jeddah flights for a citizen holding a Schengen passport, which is my case. Despite my complaint, Gotogate's customer service department refused to admit they were wrong. The advisor offered to change the Dubai-Jeddah flight for another non-religious flight on the same day with the same airline (Fly Dubai) at a time compatible with my obligations, paying a supplement of 198.34 GBP, or 229.32 EUR (at the average exchange rate of the day 1 GBP = 1.1562 EUR). Faced with this constraint, I had to accept and received confirmation by email.Still on October 13, 2023, after receiving confirmation by email, I received a call from Gotogate's customer service department informing me that the ticket could not be issued and that there was no other flight available on the same day (15/10/2023) at a time compatible with my obligations. Despite my protest and the mention of the confirmation, Gotogate's customer service department left the file in abeyance.On October 14, 2023, I called Gotogate customer service again. The advisor again told me that there were no flights available for 15/10/2023 at a time compatible with my obligations. The advisor then confirmed that I could book another ticket with another travel agency or airline and that I would be fully reimbursed by Gotogate for the booking, i.e. GBP 389.99 + GBP 198.34 = GBP 588.33; this call was presumably recorded by Gotogate.On 15/10/2024, I booked a similar ticket with my card directly with Emirates for a total of 862.15 EUR.Despite Gotogate's customer service commitment on 14/10/2023, I received no refund by 01/03/2024, i.e. more than 4 months later. This is obviously shocking, scandalous and unprofessional on Gotogate's part.This misadventure represents an additional cost of 862.15 EUR (new Emirates ticket) + 229.32 EUR (modification requested by Gotogate having no effect) i.e. 1091.47 EUR.I therefore demand a full refund of my additional costs from Gotogate.@ Gotogate. Without immediate action on your part to reimburse me for all incremental costs (1091.47 EUR), the next step is a formal legal complaint for scam, false information. Reservation MHMSM7. Your detailed response is expected shortly.And a word of advice to potential Gotogate users: please run away from this dishonest agency. | Rating: 1\n",

Apparently they used Gotogate.I booked 2 business class airfares and paid 3392.87 GBP on the 31st May 2024 for flights in September 6th and 11th.  Booking.com order was OBHYAF. A couple of weeks later I got an email from RJ, saying there had been a change to my flight, it was now economy class, and have a nice flight!  No offer of a refund for price difference.  I contacted Booking.com and said I wanted business class, they said they could not do that (plane was economy only), I said I wanted a refund of the price difference, they said RJ would not do that.  I said I wanted to cancel and get a refund, they said OK, they would process that.  I got an email saying flight had been cancelled and a refund would take about 2 weeks.  This was in August 2023. A couple of weeks later I got an email from gotogate saying RJ had changed our seat numbers back to originals so our booking was all good.  However, the class was still economy.  And in the meantime I had booked new flights with Turkish Airlines (who were fabulous, I will say).So, then started a protracted discussion with Gotogate, which could only be done by me ringing their UK phone number (why? to prevent people ringing?)  They promised me numerous times that they were cancelling the flight, but it did not occur.  I contacted RJ direct, who were not very helpful, but did tell me that the booking was still active.  With that information I managed to get Gotogate to actually cancel the booking.  They said I would have to pay a fee, plus airport taxes (why?  I wasn't flying?).  The last contact I had was the 5th of September 2023.  It is now February 2024 and no refund and no contact.

Lastly, I have searched the same flight and screen recorded it multiple times since the date of the booking and the flights I wanted still come up and to make it worse, GTG are still offering those flights.  STOP TELLINGS LIES AND STEALING FROM INNOCENT CUSTOMERS.  And I did ask for a full refund because of the changes but GTG wanted £204 cancellation fee.  Seems like that’s what you were banking on! I want a FULL REFUND!!!Original review below: I booked flights for my family holiday, ensuring I kept connections as short as possible.  After I paid, my outbound flight was changed and a 9-hour layover connecting flight was added instead.  When I reached out to Go to Gate customer service they offered to cancel but wanted to charge me £204 cancellation fee.  To make matters worse, they also sent me an email saying they had to cancel my requests for check-in luggage, so now they expect me to fly with 4 kids and no luggage.  I called and spoke to Turkish Airlines, who confirmed that some agents do dodgy things like this to make money and save money.  I have screen recordings and screen captures of me searching the flights via Skyscanner and then going to Go to Gate website, which is still showing the flight as I had booked it.  Something really dodgy going on here and I will get to the bottom of it. If I do not hear back from anyone at Go to Gate today, I will contact my card provider, I will also make a complaint to Turkish Airlines and Skyscanner.

Well that's when things took a turn; the next customer service agent said that we would not get any refund and all the fees we had to pay would be more than the refund should have been but they would cancel the flight for us anyway. I insisted this couldn't be the case as I had been told previously that although there would be fees, we would get some funds returned. I requested the call be escalated and was told there were no supervisors/management working that day but since another team had confirmed I would get a refund they would honor that. They said they would have a manager call me the next day - not surprisingly there was no call, so I called back and had another agent who also said there would be no refund even after I was told there would be one, and then told that the agents would honor what the first agent had said. I was told again there was no management/no supervisor on to escalate to and that they would call me back. Now on day three, still no phone call so I call back again and get a fourth agent who reads the notes on file and says that there may be a small refund but there are fees - which is what the first agent said. After 4 phone calls to GTG - no return calls from them and over 4 hours on the phone I was finally told I would get a refund and I got the information in writing. They told me I would only get about $130... I ended up getting almost $350. Do not work with this company, they will waste your time and jerk you around.

HenceGoToGate should take responsibility for my refund request.(2)If GoToGate passed my cancellation request through to Hahn Airprior to departure date properly, what Hahn air says is notreasonable.

            "Page 208: Booked a flight on Booking.com (which we love to use!) and did not realize that Booking.com switched us to \"Go to Gate\" (GTG).  The airline cancelled our flight and scheduled us on the next flight AFTER the cancelled flight. We wanted the flight BEFORE the cancelled flight.  We contacted GTG and told them what we wanted.  We know that there are seats available.  Then the problems began.  All of this is on recorded lines.  We were told that GTG would send our request to \"their support team\".  Strange that the agent does not have access to something like SABRE? Consumers should know that the agent you speak with in customer service apparently cannot do anything but send it to \"the support team\" - so do not expect an immediate response.  The agent told us that the support team needed to contact the airline and obtain \"authorization\" to make the requested change.  We subsequently tried to make the change with the airline, and they told us that GTG can make the change immediately and no authorization is needed because there was a flight cancellation. We believe the airline.  GTG told us that the authorization would take 14 business days to arrive from the airline.  We do not believe this either - and the airline agent laughed when we asked if this were true.  The change can be made immediately - it does not take 14 days.  We asked to speak to a supervisor at GTG.  One GTG customer service agent stated \"GTG does not have supervisors\".  We challenged.  Then the story was \"there is no supervisor on duty now\".  We asked to escalate to a senior agent.  We were told there was no one to escalate to, but then the story changed to \"someone would call\".  We asked to be transferred.  Then we were told that a supervisor will call in 48 hours. The story keeps changing.  We gave them a number to call (the number on the reservation was going to be unavailable).  Days later, when we called to check they told us they called the unavailable number - and (surprise!) - it was unavailable.  We asked about a refund.  We were told that the airline would have to Authorize a refund and that they would cancel the current request (we are now waiting FIVE calendar days for the support team to actually process our change) and then restart a new request - and that airline require 15 business days to AUTHORIZE a refund request. (The airline states that if a flight is cancelled refunds are process immediately and NO AUTHORIZATION is needed. So, we are better waiting the additional (apparently MANDATORY 12 more business days). We notice that GTG monitors these postings. How about intervening and process our requested change?UPDATE March 3, 2024After 14 business days they still did not change our reservation and I called.  SURPRISE!  They actually can change reservations without sending it to their support team.  Then I asked for the seat selection I paid for.  They will not assign a seat and will not refund the money.  They stated that if you pay for seats and there is a cancellation the payment for the seats is forfeited.

Deplorable customer service, no product knowledge, no communication - other than reading scripted messages. Truly the worst experience in over 3 decades of regular business travel -  this warrants legal counsel. This is theft! | Rating: 1\n",

This discrepancy is not only alarming but also indicative of a failure to perform a basic service that has been promised to me as a customer.I have incontrovertible evidence that Flybillet.dk has not only failed to initiate the authorized refund process but has also inappropriately extracted taxes from the tickets and allocated these funds for your own financial benefit without my consent. This action is unauthorized, unacceptable, and I presume, illegal.Your continuous assurance of processing my refund without any actual progress compels me to consider all available legal options to resolve this matter. This includes, but is not limited to, legal proceedings to ensure compliance with the consumer protection laws of Sweden, Denmark, and any other applicable jurisdictions.This situation is wholly unacceptable and demonstrates a blatant disregard for customer rights and corporate responsibility. I urge Flybillet.dk to rectify this matter by processing the full refund for my order and for my partner's, as authorized by LOT airline, without further delay or deceit.Should Flybillet.dk address this issue promptly and satisfactorily, I am willing to reconsider the public airing of this grievance. However, my patience is not limitless, and my commitment to seeking justice in this matter should not be underestimated.I expect an immediate response with a resolution plan that acknowledges the gravity of your company's oversight and outlines steps for rectifying this unacceptable situation.Sincerely,Christian Porsmose StenderPS:I insist on receiving a direct email address and a designated contact person for confidential communication of my booking details—this request comes in light of the serious nature of my complaint and the insufficiency of your current security protocols, which inappropriately depend solely on a booking number and an email for account access, meaning i cannot just put this information here. Let this serve as a clear instruction: do not direct me to your standard customer service line again, as such responses have proven futile and dismissive time and time again.

I was dead wrong for ignoring the warning and reviews of the former customers. The word \"Awful\" service was an understatement!! This company was a JOKE! Here's a quick and dirty event that happened. I bought a ticket from them since their pricing was quite cheap. Time to check in to my flight.. the reference number can't be found even by the airline company. I made a called and was directed to India customer rep... they are charging an extra $16.50 for them to check me in online. What choice do I have but to pay since my flight was in 2 hours. That's not all, my return flight??? oh gee... they canceled a day before my flight for unknown reason. I have to re-booked it again directly with the airline.Lesson learned... Don't even bother booking with them for saving a few bucks. The stress I endured was not worth it. | Rating: 1\n",
            "Page 214: This company does not deserve any star. I would urge trading standard, consumer direct or civil aviation to look into this company. It's a scam company which it's not a member of any aviation group. My flight booked in the UK was cancelled in March 2022, (reference LIRRVQ). Since then I sent dozens of emails chasing the refund, but every time the reply was \"Kindly note that we have escalated it to the concerned team\". Most recent email, simply got no reply any more. Same issue in 2023, a ticket purchased through Booking.com without knowing gotogate was the affiliate company. Again it got cancelled with no refund, fortunately this time ticket was purchased by credit card, hence was able to claim it back through credit card company. In addition, this company at that time charged £100 admin fee for two checked luggages (called airline, they actually charge only 8 Euro per luggage), and a unfair term that if flight is cancelled, this fee would not be returned. Guess this is one of the reason that flights booked through this company frequently cancelled. Skyscanner is also failing to carry out KYC check to allow such a scam company appear in their search engine. A quick check online, not difficult to see how many victims are out there. Another friend booked a ticket through booking.com in Thailand last year, had a same issue and yet to receive any refund.A kind advice, stay far away from this company and any its affiliates. Don't purchase ticket from Gotogate! Don't buy ticket through Booking.com as well. Having been using booking.com for years, I now completely stopped any business with them. | Rating: 1\n",

She told me that I would receive a confirmation by email for my new booking.24h after I received an email asking me to pay a new extra fee ̈́'as ̈́'fare hike''that was never mentionned before.I refused to pay this unlawful fare hike. I sent an email as response arguing:\"As a company selling products to customers, you must inform your client of the price they have to pay so that they can make their decision. Once the agreement is made on the price and payment is done, the price can't be changed afterwards.\"My email was left unanswered.I started an online chat with the customer support. He answered that he understood the situation but didn't have the power to cancel the extra fee. I asked him to speak to a supervisor and to send me a copy of the chat I had with him. He said we would send it and I would receive a phone call from a supervisor. None of these engagements were respected.I called customer service again, this time by phone. I asked the customer rep to speak to a supervisor. He checked my file, saw that a request for a call back had been lodged and assured me that a supervisor would call me back ASAP.I've never received this call.When I started to do my check-in online for my flight happening the following day, I couldn't do it without paying the extra fare which I was never informed about. I was forced to pay it in order to board my plane.The story gets worse...When I tried to do my online check-in 24h before my return trip, my ticket still appeared as scheduled for the initial date. Not only they forced me to pay a hidden fee, but they didn't even bother changing the booking after I had paid it!!!I chatted one more time with your customer support online. The person assured me the modification would be done and I would receive my plane ticket within 3hrs max. I explained how important it was to me in order to prepare my trip to the airport to receive it ASAP. 5hrs later, I still hadn't received the plane ticket. It was not even visible on your website!!! I called back and the customer rep assured me I would receive it on time for my plane. He couldn't even give me the departure hour.I never received it no more that I received any message from the customer rep service which was one more time useless on chat and unaccountable for their engagementsThis whole practice of increasing the price afterwards and putting me in a position in which I am forced to pay or to lose my whole flight was unlawful. Not even making sure that the change of booking had been made, or being able to give me information on my reservation was unprofessional. Of the various engagements taken by the 5 customer reps I talked to, none of them were respected. All together this was purely and simply bad customer practices at best.

            "Page 219: I booked a round trip flight from Vietnam to Koh Samui via booking.com because I just had good experiences with hotel bookings, so I thought let's give a flight booking a try.A decision I will forever reget, I have never experienced such a bad customer service before. 1 week prior to the departure gotogate.com informed me that the return flight was not possible anymore because of a change in the airline timetable. I was given the choice between a cancellation and the confirmation of a suggested alternative. I immediately confirmed the alternative and got the response from gotogate that they requested the reservation but needed the confirmation from the airline. I never heard from gotogate again, until I reached out proactively to them a few days prior to the day of the flight. What followed then was just the worst. They told me every day (only when I reached out, they didn't contact me from their end) that I will for sure get the confirmation within the 24 next hours. But I never got anything. And every day, instead of enjoying my vacation, I contacted them via chat again to  get an update and they just realized every time that the alternative they should book for me was now not available anymore. So they offered a new one - which the airline would need to confirm. So we were running in circles, going through the same process again and again. I was stranded on Koh Samui and in the end I then when they offered me a new alternative again (meanwhile multiple days later than the orginal one) I chose cancellation instead of confirmation of the alternative and booked a completely new flight on my own for immediate depature.I have to add they had stopped responding via chat or email days before and my boyfriend in Europe had to call them because I didn't want to spend a fortune on phone calls from Thailand.That was in March 2023. Ever since I have seen no money. I have written them around 10 times for an updates, getting always they same reply \"we are still waiting for the authorization of the aireline, we will refund you as soon as the request has been approved\".I'm not sure if they are actually criminal and have received the money already of if they just refuse to do their job to get my money back. I am sure I will never see my money and even if I ask for an update in 10 years they will write that they are still waiting for the authorization.I will try to involve a lawyer to make sure they don't get away with it.What makes me the most angry is that I would still sit on the island if I hadn't contacted them all the time. They just ignore their customers, they don't care if the flight alternative they requested is never confirmed, they don't care at all and give standard answers and promises that are completely stupid and wrong. | Rating: 1\n",

On October 8th I was informed via email by Gotogate that my flight was cancelled and that they would take care of the refund. Until today, I have not received my money back. After hours and hours, days and days, discussing with Gotogate Customer Service, where, honestly, one employee is more incompetent than the other, still nothing. Reasons why Gotogate Customer Service is the worst:- NONE of the phone numbers work, so you are forced to connect with an employee via chat- Every time you connect via chat you wait for approximately an hour to speak with a new employee that understands nothing about your case and tries to finish the ticket as fast as possible by giving you wrong and, well, unhelpful information. - You cannot speak to a superior, you have no direct contact person responsible for your case, you are simply pushed around. - The employees working at customer service have no idea about the cases they are working in. They continously give out wrong information because they do not read the file carefully. In many cases it was obvious that they were lying to try and get rid of me. - The employees working at customer service left the chat multiple times in the middle of the conversation, so that I had to start all over again. After months of logging in to the chat weekly and after a while daily, I was finally contacted by Gotogate by phone, as I had asked for from the beginning. Yogesh - apparently a dispute resolution employee - admitted to me that Gotagate made a mistake, as they cancelled a flight that was not refundable and was actually not cancelled by the airline. While first admitting that the mistake was clearly made by gotogate, he started haggling. First, he said we would only receive 10% of the ticket price. Then he tried to raise it to 50% and after a very onerous conversation I made clear to him that there was no legal basis for them to refund lass than 100% of the paid price. He then promised me that my refund would be confirmed within two days. That was two weeks ago and, again, I have not heard back from Gotogate. I am back at my routine, where I have to spend hours talking to employees who do not have information about my case, send me standard phrases, having the audacity to ask me to be patient, promising call-backs that never happen and so on. I will now proceed to write bad reviews in every homepage where Gotogate is known, because honestly no one deserves to be treated like Gotogate treats its customers.

            "Page 227: Flight time got changed multiple times (not their fault) and on the third change it was considerably earlier and I could no longer make that flight. I called then to cancel the flight within flight rules. I was told after waiting on hold for 1.5hrs that they would process it and it would take 5-10 working days. I then booked a replacement flight for my trip. After 10 days I had heard nothing from them, so I called back (2hrs on hold) to be told it was in process. 5 more days pass… I look online and see there should be a confirmation email of the refund being processed; I had not received one. So I called again.2.5hrs on hold!!! Was told it was in process. I called a total of 12 times because I was not receiving confirmation of the cancelled booking. The last time I called was 1 week before the flight, where I was explicitly told that it was all in process and that the airline had a backlog of up to 13 weeks and that was why I had not received any emails because they were waiting for the reply from them, but that I shouldn't worry the flight time is approaching as my application was put in previously… I wait 15 weeks. Still nothing. Call again, about a the refund. They say they will look into it… I then receive an email for refund application for a no show for a flight…I call them about this. End up escalating all the way to managers. Who simply apologised and said it was too late to process the refund.So basically, despite calling 12 times and speaking to different people each time; nobody even processed the cancellation due to flight time change.Over £600 it cost me having to pay for 2 flights; feel absolutely tricked in a long con. Of course because of the elapsed weeks, I couldn’t go through the credit card company. And when I requested transcripts of our calls, they omitted the calls where it was stated explicitly that I would receive a refund, and only sent the calls where it was ‘implied’.Meaning I couldn’t take it further. They’re not worth the hassle. If you want to take the risk of useless service; pay on your credit card and deal with it straight through them. | Rating: 1\n",

            "Page 231: Once again, we have been saved by the amazing support of Singapore Airlines for providing my friend with an alternative within the same day. Thank you for that :)In the past, I wrote a post/story about our horrible experience with the \"Etraveli Group Supersaver/GotoGate\" Well, guess what? It's still as horrible as usual, and the reviews aren't lying either. Isn't it a sign from the customer to do something to improve your customer experience?So, I have booked several tickets on Booking.com (without knowing their partnership with GoToGate) from Amsterdam to Ho Chi Minh City for a few friends of mine. The departure date would be the 30th of January, arriving on the 31st in Ho Chi Minh City. However, there was a certain flight from \"Singapore to Ho Chi Minh City\" that didn't meet the requirements with a minimum layover of at least 1 hour and 30 minutes. Therefore, action was required from our beloved travel agency, but they came up with this unreasonable proposal:Please find the alternative option below:Mon, 29 Jan - SQ323Departing: Amsterdam (AMS) at 10:25Arriving: Singapore Changi (SIN) at 05:55Wed, 31 Jan - SQ8536Departing: Singapore Changi (SIN) at 07:20Arriving: Ho Chi Minh City (SGN) at 08:30Yeah right... While all my other friends had another proposal:Mon, 30 Jan - SQ323Departing: Amsterdam (AMS) at 10:25Arriving: Singapore Changi (SIN) at 05:55Wed, 31 Jan - SQ178Departing: Singapore Changi (SIN) at 09:50Arriving: Ho Chi Minh City (SGN) at 11:00When looking on their website Booking.com and GoToGate, there were many alternative flights remaining that day, like the one proposed to my friend. But yeah, their laziness won't end here because we received the following email from \"etraveli/supersaver/gotogate or whatever you want to call them\":\"Please be informed that as per Singapore Airlines' schedule change policy, we can rebook the passengers only on the same fare type originally booked.Kindly note we rechecked the availability, and since the preferred flight does not have the same type of fare available, we are unable to rebook you on your preferred flight; the only option available is the one offered to you, which is also subject to seat availability.We request you kindly reply with your preferred selection from the two alternatives offered in the initial email so that we can proceed further with your request, or you can contact the airline directly to check about the available flight options.\"Of course, blame it on Singapore Airlines again, even though they were the ones who were 'ABLE' to correctly change that particular flight to a reasonable one, and yes the fare type was the same.After all these years, they still want you to contact the airline directly because they are incapable of fixing it themselves.So, still, my advice is (still): Avoid the Etraveli Group at all costs. Buy from Singapore Airlines or any airline directly. I would rather pay 10% more for a ticket than have a bad customer experience. | Rating: 1\n",

Lufthansa paid Gotogate the full amount of my flight refund, but Gotogate did not inform me nor transferred the money to me.

            "Page 235: I work as a scientist at a Swedish university and often travel for conferences, usually purchasing tickets directly from the airline. However, due to positive experiences with booking accommodations through booking.com, I decided to try booking a flight through them as well. On November 7th, I bought a flight ticket via booking.com (Reference number 40-433341504). Realizing an error in the date immediately, I canceled the booking and made a new purchase. I contacted booking.com to explain the situation. They informed me they were requesting a full refund from the airline, a process typically taking 7 to 10 business days.After this period, I reached out to booking.com's live chat and telephone support, learning that the airline had not responded to their refund request, and they couldn't confirm the refund duration. When I directly contacted the airline, The airline has explicitly stated that they have not received any payment and have not issued any tickets, thus indicating that there is no refundable transaction available. I promptly informed booking.com via email and phone. However, they claimed the airline was unresponsive and couldn't provide a refund timeline. It has been two months already, and they still don't know when they can issue the refund, continuing to claim that the airline is unresponsive.During a conversation with booking.com customer care, an officer named MAJA stated, \"Please wait for this message before contacting us regarding this issue again, as it may affect your place in the queue.\" I found this concerning, and I consider this flight reservation company affiliated with booking.com to be engaging in fraudulent behavior. I've already warned all my university friends and colleagues against booking tickets through booking.com or SWEDISH gotogate. If anyone faces similar issues, I suggest initiating a chargeback through the credit card company. | Rating: 1\n",

I have called 3 times to gotogate customer care, but everytime, \"they say your voice is not audable and they simply cut the line\". If this is genuine ticket, I just want the e-ticket with barcode from the official airways. I would request e-ticket from gotogate to prove me wrong.-- after few days of booking, I reached to the customer care of Bangkok airways.Luckily, the bookings were correct, but the booking reference number provided by Gotogate was wrong, so the bookings were not visible on official bangkok air site. When I requested to search with name, then the bookings were appeared with different booking reference number. Such a buggy site or gotogate intentionally giving wrong airline booking reference number so that you can pay for the checkin fee. I would request everyone to avoid gotogate booking site to have a peace of mind. Don't get trapped with lowest amount, anyways they increase this price in-between the booking process | Rating: 2\n",

My kids have been booked under a different PNR but they show as adults now. Our friends' change request is still stuck but the agent explained that since the passport shows the middle name of their daughter which they didn't enter during the booking (middle names are not mandatory) GTG asked for the name change and the fee. He escalated the case and finally linked both requests together. I have to admit that this agent was extremely efficient, patient and throrough (the first one since I started calling and chatting 2 weeks ago). Big shout out to him! I am adding a star for this.

I opened a claim with the European Consumer Centre to get legal assistance now.Dec 5: It's been a week. Our friends received a call from GTG asking them to look at their emails and immediately hanging up. No email so they had to contact them to ask for a resend. The email asks to send their daughter's passport for a name change. I guess it's a standard text. Passport sent by email, now waiting again. I didnt' receive anything, no call, no email so I contacted them and they sent an email asking for my son's passports. Sent them and now waiting again.Dec 1: Still waiting for a solution. It's been 4 days. I have been contacting GtG daily but there has been no progress. I have been asked to wait and nobody can tell me how long.Nov 27:I booked a return flight from Frankfurt to Tokyo with Japan Airlines through GTG for myself and my family. Through some weird system error, my 2 teenage sons have been booked as children even though I entered the correct dates of birth during the booking process. They both now have an invalid child ticket and Japan Airlines confirmed they will not be able to board as they need an adult ticket. Our friends who booked the same itinerary have the same issue with their daughter’s ticket. We opened claims with the GtG customer service who confirmed they have escalated them to the department in charge but they are unable to provide a date for this to be resolved. Between our 2 families we have spent over 9000€ so this situation is more than stressful! We actually tried to simulate a booking by entering our kids as adult passengers and the GtG system will not even allow that! It triggers an error message saying adult passengers need to be 18 and over! I sincerely hope GtG will resolve that issue in a timely manner and with no extra charge.

            "Page 239: First, I’d like to recommend all the viewers of this to never book through booking.com. If you need assistance, you will be on your own! It is a stressful path of agony and suffering that have ruined my New Year’s Eve. Sunday (New Year’s Eve) I have a flight from Copenhagen to Malaga with Swiss Airlines that I bought through Booking.com. Thursday, I realised a mistake in my name on my flight. Thus I immediately called customer support, who directed me to the airline. Then when I called the airline, I was informed that this was the responsibility of booking.com.I reached out to booking.com (again), They let me know that it was possible to change the name indeed, however I had to pay an extra fee. They sent me a link (via gotogate) and I paid this fee. I waited half a day, then they called after figuring out that due to having included my frequent flyer ID the name change was not possible, therefore I had to pay the difference in price for a new ticket and thus I had to pay a higher fee. I complied. Friday I called them to get an update and I was told that the name change was in process, but they would not specify how long it would take. I called them again, I was told I needed to pay yet another fee and they would send a link - at this point I decided that they probably was not going to be able to do the change. A few hours later I tried to access the link but it had expired. I called them again and was told they would send me another link, but she could not tell me when it would come nor if I was able to make my upcoming flight on Sunday - she just told me that I should call them again in a few hours. When I called them again, I was told the complete opposite by the customer service worker - he said that the payment had  been processed and only the last technicalities. I asked him why his colleagues had told me the opposite before, he said he was sorry and that it would all be okay. I just had to wait and call in again. I asked him to get in writing what he had told me, which he refused. He could not give me any time frame, but simply told me to wait. I went to sleep and this morning woke up to an email from booking.com. They wrote they had been calling me diligently and due to the flight being in 24 hours, and they were unable to get hold of me to confirm the name change, they would not be able to do this. They mentioned they would refund the extra fees I had paid. Furthermore, they tell me to contact the airline directly, but when doing this, I am informed that Booking.com has cancelled my ticket. Thus, I have paid for a product and extra fees that I haven’t received. To sum up: their costumer service workers are puppets that cannot provide any real information. I request anyone not to believe any word they’re saying as they are not there to help you but there to shut you up and get done with the case. Furthermore, they cannot provide any real customer services and they try to wash their hands clean by saying they call “diligently.” Now, I have wasted three days of trying to sort my problem out, all while they should’ve told me in the beginning it wasn’t possible instead of explaining the inability being due to me missing in action. Furthermore, they have cancelled my ticket (that I have paid for and that they won’t refund) in the process, so I can’t even try to correct the errors myself. | Rating: 1\n",

My friends booked same ticket via a travel agency and have been refunded THE DAY AFTER. So I am sure GotoGate HAVE RECEIVED the refund from the airline. They know that they can hold the money in their account before sending it back to my credit card, It pays actually around 5% so it a good income.

I filled in all information and attempted card payment. Towards the end of this exercise, I saw a message that the booking has failed and I should try again. There is still one ticket available. I tried again and this time it went through.  I had several emails from Booking.com and it also said that the actual booking was done through GotoGate, which their sister company. After four days, incidentally I was checking my credit card transactions, wherein I was charged twice for the flight ticket by Booking.com. I am disgusted that:Their system wrongly displayed a message that I should try again, even when the booking has actually gone through. I have a doubt that they are practicing cheap tricks to extract money from customers, and especially taking advantage of non-returnable tickets.Their website is fraudulent. They give wrong messages and compell customers to book again. The available number of tickets shown by their system is also a fraud. When one ticket was shown as available, if the booking has gone through all right, how can it show the number of available ticket as one again?In the end, after 24 hours of banging my head against a wall, they came up with a solution to cancel one of the bookings, after charging a penalty of £255. Inefficient systems, inaccessible customer service, Fraudulant messages on the system...All this costed me £255. Rubbish website.

I purchased flight tickets through their platform, intending to include our newborn baby in the booking. Shockingly, their ineptitude and lack of communication with the airline prevented them from making this seemingly straightforward adjustment. Unbelievable!When I attempted to rectify this, their customer service proved to be an absolute nightmare. Not only did they fail to assist in adding our baby to the booking, but their refusal to provide a full refund was the final straw. It's appalling that a company supposedly facilitating travel couldn't manage such a simple request and then had the audacity to deny a reasonable refund.Communication? Non-existent. Support? Abysmal. Transparency? Completely lacking. GoToGate's disregard for customer needs is utterly appalling. What's worse is their attempt to swindle customers with additional charges when alterations are necessary. It's beyond comprehension how a company can operate with such disregard for customer satisfaction.Save yourself the anguish and avoid GoToGate. The allure of cheaper prices quickly fades away when you're confronted with their incompetence and their readiness to exploit customers. My experience has been a cautionary tale, and I implore anyone considering their services to steer clear and opt for a more reputable and customer-centric alternative. GoToGate, you've not only lost a customer but also tarnished any semblance of trust in your brand. Shame on you! | Rating: 1\n",

If no problem arises in which you need to change flights or ask for customer service, then it is great. However, when problems do happen, the customer service is horrendous. For expensive and long flights, may be best to avoid them if problems arise as they won't help you as much. Due to my heart condition I had to postpone the flight the same day. The chat is not available 24/7 as they say. My flight was 9pm and I started trying to use the chat at 6am and no one came. A couple hours later, I tried again. I had to wait 30 minutes for someone and when that person came, the rep wasn't helpful. It took me another 3 tries and spent 2 hours waiting for them to help me. By then it was 1pm. The last rep charged ~$100 for airline flight change and another ~$45 for their service fee. The charge was immediate and yet they did not submit the request til 7pm, which is past the airline's cutoff time. I did not know about this until today's flight as I now had to pay another $150 to airline directly for no show fee of the previous flight. So in a nutshell, if you need to change, please call them rather than use chat. Or better yet, deal with the airline directly even if it's $10-20 more. I just lost $150 thanks to their speed of customer service. 2 stars because they offer good price but when problem arise, it's more expensive than other options as they can't help you. | Rating: 2\n",

I booked a return ticket from New Delhi to Washington D.C. on 9th June 2022. The booking details are Passenger Name: SYED ANZAR AHMAD SHARFI, Order number: LO3F1I, Booking references: Flight: 1X65KY, e-Ticket number(s): 0655269618476, Check-in Ref.: OFCEDL(SV), Travel Dates: 20th July 2022 (Starting From New Delhi via Riyad) - 21st September 2022 (Starting from Washington D.C. via Jeddah). On 5th July 2022, due to some personal reasons, we had to cancel this ticket after discussion with the gotogate.com customer service and paying airline cancellation fee of 54 USD and a handling fee of 39 USD per person which was to be deducted from the refund. Ever since I have been waiting for the refund. I have reached gotogate customer service serval time, just to speak to a new customer service agent who had no clue what was spoken with their previous colleague (no case notes). Which so far resulted in no refund. Each time, I have been told that refund is pending with Airline which is yet to be cleared. Once cleared from Airlines you will receive refund, the customer service only manage the Airlines tickets and do not deals with refunds(it is deal with different backend team which cannot be reach out by the customers). I am not sure what kind of business you are running where reconciliation takes not just weeks but months or in my case over year.

Call again third time and speak with an agent. First of all he struggles to understand a simple request like change a flight from date x to y and give me a price. A few times he gets months confused (someone in company needs to listen to recording of phone call). Finally tells me can't find the same flight - guess what I'm live on both the airline website  and gotogate and same flight available for all 3 date options I gave him. He can't explain why can't get the same flight even though it is clearly available to book both via their website and airline website for the same date4. Offers me an inferior route with over 12 hours layover for guess what around 2.8x the price at which I can buy a brand new ticket!! 5. When I say look I can buy a brand new ticket for almost 1/3rd the price you date change - he tells me that ticket pricing is dynamic and changes by the minute. I tell him yes but I'm seeing live prices on your website and the airline - he just repeats it is dynamic pricing6. Ask if I can speak with someone else - puts me on hold and says no one available7. When I ask can I then somehow complain so the case gets looked at - he says send email. I ask what email address - says you can find it on website but I will not give you the email address!!I'm not expecting a free change of date and fully well expect to pay any fare difference but it cannot be almost 2.8 times what a brand new ticket will cost me. | Rating: 1\n",

When a refund was necessary for boarding tax and extra luggage, my dealings with Booking.com, starting 11/12, were filled with empty assurances and no effective resolution.Further inquiries with the airline revealed differing responsibilities for refunds: the airline for the first trip and Booking.com for the second. Despite this clarity, Booking.com’s handling of the situation over 10 days was marked by poor communication and a lack of satisfactory response.This ordeal leads me to strongly discourage using Booking.com or Gotogate for flight bookings.

            "Page 247: I've been a fan of booking.com for several years, for booking hotels mostly. This year, booking.com partnered up with gotogate.com to start providing flights. This was exciting for me, as it meant I'd have both flights and accommodation all under one umbrella.I had booked another family flight via gotogate for the summer and while it wasn't a great experience dealing with them, it wasn't too bad either.Hsving said that, I believe partnering with gotogate has been an abysmal disaster for booking.com and as of today, I've cancelled all bookings (hotels and flights!) I have with booking.com as a result, based on three issues:1) when I pay a premium to ensure flexibility of my tickets (especially when bought 6-9 months ahead), it's so I don't have to have a headache down the line. This is on top of the actual airfare and it goes to the agent, not the airline (I still need to cough up fare difference if any!)2) when I ask to change dates (based on said flexibility), I do not expect to get a quote for a fare difference that is 110% of the original fare paid and all legs get bumped down to Economy from Business class?!?!?. Now I know it can happen, but imagine my surprise when I go direct to the airline (within an hour of the revised quote) and was able purchase the same tickets for less than 50% of the fare difference I got quoted by gotogate? That was the first break in the trust I'd always had in them.3) so I go ahead and cancel the tickets, processed the refund (minus the extra bit paid to gotogate for flexibility). As you can imagine, it's a fair whack and I've had to buy new tickets for the same journey. Got an email confirming refund will be done within 14 days. All good.......Two and a half weeks later, I'm chasing up as to why my refund hasn't been credited? I have to go through chat each time - same old same old' \"it's being processed\"; at this point, I'm patient (these things happen) and get follow up emails that you can't reply back to (unmonitored mailbox from individual-signed emails, that you keep replying to but get no responses or even a bounce back response that it's unmonitored).Almost daily follow ups and its a different person each time, with the same pat responses.1 week after the SLA for when my refund should be in my account, every person I chat to tells me the same \"it's been escalated and prioritised as urgent\", but no follow up and no response and no feedback on whats actually happening.You might get someone random emailing you that they tried to call you (even though no such call was made), but also from an unmonitored mailbox that you cannot reply to or debate whether such a call was ever made!)Here's the funny thing, I've dealt with the airline in question for almost 10 years and even in the most contentious or difficult situations (very rare), they usually refund within 7-10 days in my personal experience.Get on a chat with gotogate/ booking.com and they close the chat on you if you insist on getting concrete answers vs. pat responses; when you call and insist on escalating to a manager since this has been pending for more than 3 weeks with no movement, they conveniently hang up on you.At this point, I've simply cancelled all bookings with booking.com and want nothing to do with gotogate, seeing as this is the level of service they've now devolved into.It is especially galling to see this level of abysmal customer service from gotogate, with no ramifications or accountability at any level of the organisation, and what feels like being abetted by booking.com to boot.25Dec23 - follow up: I thought it beneficial to add a follow up since my initial post. I took the liberty of going directly to the airline last week, to get to the bottom of gotogate's assertions that the refund was pending with the airline....according to the airline, that's untrue and gotogate could have refunded my money to me at any point in time. When I relayed this to both booking.com and gotogate, the latter hasn't had any response for me. Booking.com started following up with me, but then tansferred the issue to gotogate and have since washed their hands off this. No surprise there. | Rating: 1\n",

Finally the confirmation from them to cancel and submit a refund, was 'completed' the same day of departure!! after another painful waiting time. Unfortunately, a few weeks later, again another useless email asking to contact them, so after a couple of hours and several teams involved, someone confirmed me that the cancelation rules of the flying company had fees over the price of the refund, leaving me with no solution and no money, and just a suggestion of contacting the flying company myself. The feeling left is they did not wanted to cancel the flight and get the refund on time.  They don't care about refunding money at all. Such a pain contacting them every time. On the top of this, after confirming by the customer service agent to send me all the transcriptions of my conversations during the process, this was never delivered except the last conversation with the conclusions.

They constantly lie to get you off of the phone, saying a manager or their refund department will call back with more details. They told me this every time I called and I never received a call back.Gotogate claimed the airline had not refunded them and was not responded to their request, therefore they could not refund me. However, I reached out to the airline directly (airline responded within a 12 hrs), and the airlines provided proof that they refunded Gotogate on Oct. 4 (December at the time of writing and Gotogate still claims the airline has not refunded them). This seems to be a common experience for others as well.4 days ago I contacted my bank to charge back my funds and I have received my money back. Gotogate still withheld their service fee for processing a refund so it is clear they were holding my refund and once my bank got involved, they processed it.If anyone else is having a bad experience with getting a refund from Gotogate, contact the airline directly to see how much of a refund you are owed and if Gotogate does not refund you in a reasonable amount of time, go directly to your bank.To any potential customers, do not use this service.

They took weeks to even process the refund from the airline, and claim they cannot pay me back despite being a huge corporation; £1200 is a huge amount of money to me, it’s nothing to these companies.

Despite firm replies claiming it was in progress, a revelation on 30/11/2024 from China Southern Airline's headquarters indicated that no refund claim was filed.Upon checking with China Southern Airline's headquarters in Mainland China, they confirmed not receiving any of my ticket refund claims.

As per a good practice I saved the \"check and pay\" screen page for my reference.After paying by a credit card we soon get an emails from Booking.com confirming the flight with the airline booking reference number. It seems that all needed was well done.However, this is the first time we have encountered problems at the airport at check-in time because the Malaysian Airline personnel refused to process our two suitcases. I was showing them our \"check and pay\" ticket information with two 20 kg checked bags included....They checked our tickets on their airline system and informed us that they have a different version of tickets on their system, which includes only the \"Light economy luggage allowance\" without the checked bags although our \"check and pay\" screenshot showed two 20 kg checked bags allowance.My wife and I were surprised,  shocked and also devastated at this time.The airline personnel indicated that I am not the first customer with such a problem.Trying to help us, they advise us to repack our suitcases and pay over 1500 AUD for the excess luggage in order to continue our flight to London.The Booking.com and GoToGate didn't deliver us the flight tickets as per details of our \"check and pay\" order.Our claim for compensation was diverted to GoToGate.com but after 3 months waiting the GoToGate refused to compensate us for the incurred cost of over 1500 AUD paid for the excess luggage although obvious deficiency in their service system (probably software problem and/or their service being  located in India, many other customers experience similar events as per many reviews for Booking.com and GoToGate).Be aware that the Booking.com includes many other partners and therefore their service quality is deteriorating. And do not trust some reviews made by commercial hired website agents/contractors providing services for TAs as these could be misleading. Even Trust pilot.com rating for these two TAs mentioned above might be too optimistic.🤔Hence, based on my experience and also other customers included in the productreview.com.au or au.trustpilot.com I will not recommend their flight services even to my enemies.And finally, maybe there is a new role for the Trustpilot.com to inform ACCC on such frequent events involving such TA with substandard quality service? | Rating: 1\n",

I have raised several requests to have this corrected, Saudi Airways do have a policy where 3 letters can be corrected, however it can only be requested by the agency who booked the flight, in this case GotoGate.Having raised so many requests I was promised that it would be requested to the airline and resolved in good time ahead of my flight not to worry. I have been following that up this week, receiving replies that there is no specific update, but that it is in hand. I then received an email today basically saying, sorry it is not possible, speak to the airline, if you want to rebook let us know. To say I have been stonewalled is an understatement. I have asked for escalation, to be able to speak with the booking team directly etc. No, only allowed to speak to the customer representative, who knows absolutely nothing, cannot even provide a request reference that GotoGate used when requesting the name change with the airlines, nothing. Just a sorry, we cannot help you attitude! How is it possible that something a simple as correcting 2 x letters of a first name of a ticket, first requested months ago, can be such an impossibility.I will never ever book via GotoGate (or probably any agency) in future and will always book with an airline direct. Beyond useless. And now I have to hope and prey that within 24 hours of flying the airline will be able to update the name. If not I will lose £££ thousands in hotel fees, have 4 x absolutely distraught children and a wife, who are looking forward to seeing relatives for the first time pre-covid.Beyond useless is how I would describe GotoGate.

            "Page 263: Initially, I did not even know that I was booking through GoToGate, because I was doing my booking through Momondo. Anyway, the booking went fine, cheap, quick, and confirmed in minutes. However, the ticket was one thing but the seats were something else what was charged around $30 each per person per flight. But OK even that is not so bad. All of the hassle started when the airlines shifted my return flight one day before original date. This was not acceptable and I decided to rebook. Initially, it seemed just fine, paid the requested amount for the rebooking and chose the flight offered during the conversation. One day passed but my information on the official airline app did not change. Figured it would take more time so gave them another day to resolve it. Tomorrow still nothing. Started the chat and I was reassured that all is good, they escalated my case to make sure all is taken care in time. Two days later still nothing. This time I was fortunate enough to be in the states and I found their phone number and started riding it twice a day minimum to make them do the rebooking. The answer they gave me every time was that the airliner would not send them confirmation of the rebooking and they are escalating my case. This took 6 days and they all read their scripted material without hickup. Kept escalating my case, if it was a stick it would reach the moon. The last day, hours before the flight I called and demanded my rebooking to be finalized, which eventually made them to lift the authorization to be transferred to the airliner. At this point the airliner resolved my problem in matter of minutes and rebooked me for the requested flight. So my conclusion is that GoToGate is most certainly in debt with the airline company and could not do anything or just did not care about my problems, either way not good. I consider myself very lucky not to lose my flight. Heard many people had worse experiences with them.Absolutely do not recommend as travel agency. I ended up having to deal with them because I did not check before how they did their business. It is not worth to lose sleep over few tens of dollars more with good and verified agency.

It was Vistara for domestic and Virgin Atlantic for international sector.Due to covid, the ticket was made open ticket for the return segment (LHR to BLR) to be used by 31st Dec 2023. I have been contacting their office for last 4 weeks and must have discussed with several of their call centre agents. Nobody was able to complete the re-booking. Every time they gave some excuse for not resolving the issue. The issues they reported were:a) Child is over 16 years now when booking was made the child was 15 years old. For that I told them full adult fair was paid while booking itself hence it was not an excuseb) No flights available for the dates i requested. Then i challenged them as the seats were available in airline website as well as other travel agent websites for the dates i requested, then they use to say they would discuss with airline and get back. They never used to get back hence then when i called them next, told them, book any day in November for 2 passengers and for 1 in December then they said they need to price the ticket. I told them it was flexible ticket that they should charge me extra (I had paid extra Rs 42,272 while booking as mentioned in their invoice which is apart from airline ticket charge). On 4th Nov an agent called Ayesha came out with the most laughable solution, that is to rebook, she asked we had to pay Rs 340,000 per passenger extra for November journey and additional Rs 240,000 for December journey per person. When I pointed to her that the current price on the same airline website or other travel agents shows almost 1/10th of what Ayesha quoted, she asked me she can't help which is their company policy and airline is charging them, she asked me to speak to airline directly. I told her that it was basically by over quoating, the travel agent or airline or combination of both denying my right to have return journey when i have purchased flexible open return ticket (By paying premium price while booking).I asked Ayesha to arrange immediate refund for the price paid for flexible ticket which was travel agent's product but not airline's, and also ask airline to refund for the return journey ticket price as it was booked through the Gotogate. She kept on saying it was not possible to refund. I told her there are no terms and conditions which say they can't refund when they can't provide retun ticket having taken the money from my card. Finally she said she would escalate to concerned department and hung up the phone (perhaps disconnected itself but she didn't have the curtesy to call back to mention the call got disconnected.

Over the space of a few months our flights were changed several times - this is fine because there are so many flights it makes sense some are cancelled. However, after the 4th or 5th reschedule, one of our layovers was reduced from a few hours to 50 minutes. This made us nervous as any slight delay in our previous flight and we miss the rest of our international flights and we're stuck in the wrong country. We called several times and I was transferred 19 times over the space of 3 hours. Each time I had to re-explain the issue to the new person, who would then say they were transferring me to the \"correct\" department, and the loop continues. I called the airline to see if we could be put on an earlier flight, and they said there are flights every hour between these two destinations and we could be put on an earlier one, but since our flights were managed by GoToGate, and they refused to do anything at all, we could not change our flights.Well, our concerns were correct, because the flight was delayed by 1 hour. Fortunately they held the flight back for us, but we had to run to the gate.

I had to cancel my flight because of a death in the family. They told me to file a dispute with the airline first (Fiji Airways) which I did and they approved it within 24 hours of emailing them. They did say to bring it to this piece of doo doo agency with the approval confirmation # and they still didn't issue the refund, even though the airline approved it. I had to call my credit card company to dispute it and go to issue a warning stating they will not follow up with a refund because of the dispute and because they do not want to issue a refund that is rightfully mine.

During this extended period, the lack of reasonable updates and communication has been astonishing. I have relied solely on their website for information.Despite making multiple calls to the agency, I received nothing but empty promises. They assured me that my issue had been escalated on numerous occasions, but no one from their end ever bothered to contact me.Now, after three years of waiting, the resolution they offer is to deny my refund because the airline supposedly did not pay them the required amount. This means I am left with nothing, despite having paid for the tickets in good faith. I find this extremely unfair as a customer.Moreover, it is clear that the agency has shown no intention of taking responsibility for resolving the matter with the airline, which is, after all, their role as a third party ticket seller. To make matters worse, my recent call to their agent was met with rudeness as they told me to contact the airline directly.This level of service is completely unacceptable. I strongly urge others to exercise caution when dealing with this agency, as they have demonstrated a lack of commitment to their customers' interests and well-being. | Rating: 1\n",

My order number is MLUL49.i bought a ticket from gotogate for Dhaka to  Paris on Wednesday the 1st of November 23  .i went to airport as usual but surprisingly airline staff at the boarding pass desk told me they only able to find one part of my journey on their system not final part of the journey to Paris . They even showed me on their desk computer screen .I immediately contacted Gotogate and spent 1.5 hours ,speaking to 3 different staffs but they were absolutely clueless and confused .They were unable to give any answers why my ticket wasn’t available on the airline system according to the bookings or the confirmation email they sent to me ? Again no response .They asked me to contact airline about this , I said I bought ticket from you so it’s your responsibility to contact the airline and get me the ticket I bought so that I can fly today but no reply  .I felt that I am a victim of fraud and scam and they did that to me on purpose .After waiting 3 hours at the airport,i returned to home . I never faced such traumatic experiences in 19 years of my travelling life .Finally I asked for a refund but mentioned to me that they would charge me around £300 fee , I asked what is my fault here and why can’t I have the full refund? Again no answer .Then I basically told him I will call my bank to report the transaction to be stopped and he hang up on me .i was upset yes but i will do everything in my power to recover my hardworking money . I have already reported the transaction to the bank and requested to suspend the transaction. please avoid this scam and thieves!!! | Rating: 1\n",

Booked a flight through Booking.com (which I'll never do again now thanks to this experience), turns out it was actually GoToGate that did the booking. Everything seemed fine until I was notified by the airline that a flight had changed to 24 hours later. This was an unacceptable change so contacted support. They advised there was an alternative route that occurred on the same dates as the original booking but had to put in a \"request\" to rebook it. After a week, contacted again to check the status. New person had no idea what I was talking about and would make the \"request\" again. Followed up a few days later and was told the request was rejected. So I opted to have the flights cancelled. As this was a change of over 3 hours, I am entitled to a full refund if I decline the change. They told me they can't refund me until the airline refunds them and that they don't know how much it will be. This sounds like their problem not mine and should have provided me my full refund on the spot. An email received said to track your refund check your booking, but now my booking doesn't even come up when searched. I engaged my bank to perform a chargeback from these scammers. I have also had to pay thousands more to rebook the same flights elsewhere. I regret ever making a booking with them.

Not even approximately. Never again. Terrible service, for no saving whatsoever.Ps: I am editing this review adding this piece as I cannot reply to the GoToGate reply below. That reply just shows everybody how poor the customer focus of this company is. Instead of saying something like \"we apologise for the inconvenience please write us an email at xxx providing yyy and we will sort it out\", they question the truthfulness of what I am saying and ask for a code I wasn't asked to share in here and didn't even submit in here (as i wasnt asked).

Thankfully last time I spoke to them I ask for a full record check, proved I had the email from Wizz air saying go to gate had the refund and then weirdly enough they were able to see that on their accounts (there was officially stunned silence at the other end of the phone). I got this in email proof from go to gate too that they had the refunded money and would be sorting it to be sent to me.  I then got a few emails asking for bank details but What a surprise no refund. Called again only to be told the same scripted spiel, they had no money sent from Wizz air blah blah blah but as soon as I told them about the email they sent the last time proving they had told me they had the refund (after 20 mins of letting them lie) they decided oh no it will be with you in a few days (again this is now in email) I highly doubt that money will be with me in a few days. This company is fraudulent and will not sort of provide any form of refund. However they can feel free to hire me since I’ve wasted so much money calling them up ans having to listen to the same scripted lies over and over again that I’ll be good to go with no training needed. | Rating: 1\n",

After booking, I checked out the website of the airline that they had booked me on. I was able to get their most premium option plus an extra bag for less than gotogate had charged (they charged me $75 for one bag, whereas it was included in my price on the airline's site and and extra bag on top of that was only $50). Thinking I had 24 hours for a full refund, I booked and then went ahead and looked back at the website. They were going to refund me minus extra \"third party\" services I had selected ($40). Initially, I was just curious if I could still access these services, given that I am going to be traveling on the exact same flight, so I sparked up a chat. The person (\"Mai H\") did not respond to my questions at all. She said that the \"non-refundable services were non-refundable.\" I f***ing get it, but if they're non-refundable, then why can't I still use them? They also shouldn't offer these things while saying everything is refundable within 24hours. Lies. 2nd of all, Mai said that they would also be taking $100 off because that's what the airline charges for cancellations. If that's the case, then they also should absolutely not be advertising 24hr cancellation. Pissed, I called the their listed phone number. The person on the phone at least was able to respond to my question about the services (they're associated with the booking, which honestly is bullsh*t in this scenario, but w/e at least he HAD a clear response), but was still telling me that the amount they would be able to refund was less than what their website was listing.

The problem is that our son was NOT booked on the new itinerary!!! And he was no longer booked on the original either! Therefore we paid for a leg of the journey and he had NO booking!!! This would seem to be your fault and not the airline!!! NEVER USE THIS COMPANY or BOOKING (dot com) to book a flight. This happened in August and STILL NOT RESOLVED! We are down £800. We booked a return flight from Edinburgh to Lilongwe passing through Doha and Addis Ababa in June 2023. Two weeks before the flight we received an email saying the flight from Addis to Lilongwe was no longer available and a new booking had been made via Blantyre in Malawi to Lilongwe. When my 20 year old son arrived at Addis Ababa to catch the flight to Blantyre he was told he had no booking. They eventually found his name on a list on the flight directly to Lilongwe but apparently it was not confirmed or paid for. THIS WAS PAID IN FULL ON BOOKING. After fruitless attempts to resolve it with Customer Services on the phone while he was standing at the desk, he had no option but to buy a new return ticket from Addis Ababa to Lilongwe. This cost nearly £800. My son is a student. He was on his way to volunteer in a hospital in Malawi!! The original flight that we were told was not available in fact was available and he was on it. PAID FOR TWICE!!! We spent HOURS of time on the phone to this company only to be told that they were contacting the airline about a refund and there was no option but to wait. Meanwhile there were issues with the return flight because of the fact that he was counted as a NO SHOW for the flight that he was told he was not booked on to. Again it took hours of phone calls (direct to airlines in the end as this company refused to help) and stress to finally make sure he was accepted on to the return flight from Addis Ababa to Edinburgh. Now that he is home we have just received an email saying that the airline (Ethiopian) are denying the refund and if we want to continue pursuing it we have to contact Customer Services again. We have proof all this which we have already sent to them with no acknowledgment.

Surely not a coincidence, these sites have “bots” that adjust the prices when you click pay…basically a scam software.The call center admin whom I spoke to, said the only way I get my refund in full is that had to pay a fee. I agreed to pay this fee of roughly $80…in order to get it over with. I did a little more research on the company and turns out it’s a third party company that would take your money first and would TRY to book your flight with the airline themselves, without the guarantee of a ticket unlike booking directly with the airline.I highly recommend to never use this site. When I called it seems their call center was out sourced to India…clearly I spoke to someone who was reading of a manual. This is high unacceptable. Disgusting scam. | Rating: 1\n",

As in late August early September they partially refunded me half of the ticket.Being passed over from one person to the other is an absolute ridiculous way of being treated inhumanely as possible. These companies have call centres in India and the language barrier being another issue. When u ask them you get told that someone shall call within the next 48hrs or an by an email update. Not a single call or an email to be updated, alternatively I’ve been calling them and the airline to be told that all the responsibility falls upon GotoGate.Ive been calling GotoGate and the airline back and forth for the refund, they unnecessarily made me call the airline direct who helped me as much as they could, but said that because that I had booked through GotoGate and not directly through them,they could not issue me with a refund. But helped me through by keeping me informed that they had processed theRefund and for what ever reason GotoGate isn’t refunding me the money that was entirely GotoGates decision. I called GotoGate on Friday to be told that no one had put any information on the system for the refund to be generated. I also got told that I shall be receiving the refund in 3/4 working days. I’ve just had it enough with this company and would urge any person who wants to fly with this company directly or through booking.com to avoid it like the plague.The aftermath of dealing with this company is no less than living a nightmare. I got told that the outbound ticket got cancelled but the inbounds were good to go, when I told them if they couldn’t fly my family out how could they fly back in?..They not just spoilt my families holiday but the whole experience was a harsh lesson these cowboys taught me. An absolute joke and very unprofessional company,who employs incompetent people who think that in a worst situation if one’s polite and isn’t raising they’re voice to address a situation created by them it’s alright to mess that person about. An absolute SHAMEFUL act by this company ran by Cowboys.I didn’t want to even give them 1star but the system doesn’t allow me to. I shall be sending a copy of this link along with the call logs and names of the customer representatives of this company to IATA,ATOL and any body that looks over repremanding incompetent companies like this who give the rest of the good hard working companies out they’re a bad name too. I shall make sure that this does not happen again to anybody in any sort of degrading and inhumane way in future by exposing this company on all platforms and forums where anything to do with international travel and flying is concerned.…………………………………………………Just received feedback to my review today being the 5th of November 2023, just to add I still have not received my full refund since booking the tickets being the 4th of May and they are so bold and courageous to ask me to give them a chance for my future travels and to give them future business? Do they you think I’m stupid? Fool someone else. Every time I call I get told within 24-48hrs we shall be contacting me,and then another week passes and I call and get told the same story again. I have to keep telling them when I call, that no one has called or emailed me .. it’s been 7 months and I’m still waiting for your jackanory stories to end and for you and your phoney Indian operators to refund me my money back. Sad story and it just keeps going on and on and on ….

            "Page 286: I wish I wasn't having to write this review, but here we are.I booked an around-the-world trip with GoToGate.com, to arrange flights from UK-AUS-CAN-UK. I booked early, and there were a few re-arrangements of flights as months went by; as to be expected when you secure a ccheap booking for a flight of this length.However, what resulted was a cancellation of my ticket, meaning I had to self-fund my way to Singapore to pick-up the remaining flights. There was little-to-no-help from the agent to help resolve this issue, meaning the week before I was due to fly I was scrambling the internet to find alternative flight arrangements.26 hours before I was due to return to the UK from Canada I checked the ticket issued on my app. It was all clear, and stated I could check-in 24 hours before the flight departure time. However, when I tried to check-in 2.5 hours later (i.e. 23.5 hours before the departure), the flight had disappeared from my booking. There had been no communication from GoToGate.com that this was getting cancelled, nor were any flight re-arrangements made from them. Instead, I had to contact the airline directly to make a new booking. By this time there was no room on my original flight, because GoToGate.com had not issued my ticket with the airline. As a result I had to return back to the UK 1.5 days later than planned, resulting in lost hours and therefore lost wages.My frustrations with GoToGate.com are 2-fold. Firstly, their customer service was not up-to-scratch. I was constantly told to contact the airline myself - is this not what I paid an agent fee for? Secondly, there was an inability to re-arrange flight bookings, meaning that if I had not resolved the situation myself, I would've missed out on the entire trip.As the agency work with airlines, I have been told that I will not be eligible for a refund as the flights ran as scheduled. That is understandable, however my issue is with GoToGate.com directly, as it was them who did not issue the tickets in the first place. I have been told that there is no process for compensation from the agency, and that I have no claim. As a result the onus is on me to look into Legal Acitivty, in order to bring damages against GoToGate.com, as I am entitled to partial refund of my trip. | Rating: 1\n",

Simple's refusal is a proforma (same last time) is not to refund because \"they have already sent me the information!\" About 10 minutes of keystrokes, after 6 hours of my struggle, I gave it up. Simple now expect to get $109 for 10 minutes \"work\" and my visa has cost $212! Older folks like me, think three times about using Simple Visa because it's NOT! I hesitate to use the word scam!

So, when I contacted them back to ask why this money hasn’t been refunded I was told they will have to escalate it to the refund team to see why it hasn’t been processed to my account and that I would be contacted with an update. Did I get contacted with an update??? Of course I didn’t. So again and again I had to keep calling them to see what was happening how they could possibly have my money but are refusing to refund me. Then the next news I received I could not have even predicted, after being told on numerous occasions that the money was now with gotogate and it’s waiting to be returned to me, a gentleman on the phone now says this was never the case that they had never received the money and are still waiting for emirates to return the money to them.

I called the customer service line, but no matter which number I selected, it just kept on playing the same options and ignored my selection and it was not possible to reach anyone - I am sure this is on purpose. I found the number of the headquarters and called an English hotline. They told me that I had fallen into the trap. The flexible option is not cancellable and they would not help me. Then they offered to cancel the flight for CHF 84, only to call me later that even that was not possible.

Luftansa support clearly told me that gotogate is washing their hands off. They are scaming me and dont want to process my refund since they cancelled the flight and the gotogate is already having my money and holding it on their side.Gotogate support hasn’t listened me all day complaining about my flight cancellation and refund.

            "Page 297: I wrote a review on 25 July regarding the preposterous delay to my flight refund, which was cancelled on 16 February 2023 - 223 days ago!Imagine the lawsuit if you owed a company £1,732 for this much time and ignored their letters. On 28 July, I was informed that the airline had refunded the money back to Gotogate and now I would just have to wait a few days to receive the £1,732.06.Repeated calls resulted in mixed messages. Some operators would try to tell me \"we have not received the refund\" until I gave them the exact dates and times that I was told otherwise, and they would return to \"oh yes I can see now... please wait a few more days\".This company is trained to mislead you and delay you until you eventually give up. But £1,732 is a huge amount of money that, because it has been taken from me and is now being withheld, is causing problems in my personal life. I will not give up on this case but I am increasingly frustrated by the complete lack of care by customer service for my situation.They have had my money for 2 months, which I'm sure they are gaining interest on, and are all but refusing to give it back to me. I am repeatedly told \"the case has been escalated to the highest department, I am escalating it again now\" but when I call back, a colleague tells me \"sorry but there is no update from your last call, so they didn't escalate it. However I will do it now.\"Until the next day when I call again to verify, and find the same answer. It just feels like they deliberately send you in circles until they eventually get to keep your money.Now that the initial excuse of \"we haven't received the money from the airline yet\" can't be used, and the blame can't be passed, they seem even more unwilling to help to resolve the situation. The department that deals with refunds cannot be contacted, no complaint information can be given, and I am forced to continuously get back in touch with customer service. I am asked every time: \"please, you don't need to call us, we will be in touch with you in a few days\" but I have never - *NEVER* - been informed of an update without first having to call to drag it out of the person on the phone. There has been no proactiveness from anybody at Gotogate and nothing has ever been told to me that didn't take four phone calls to find out.So, they are not asking me \"please, don't call, we'll get in touch with you\" because they are busy and processing the issue. They are asking so I stop calling, forget about the case, and with no evidence of intending to give me any information.223 days and counting. I hope I will not be writing this at 8 months, 9 months, 10 month intervals, but I will pursue this for years if needs be.Please, save yourselves the stress - avoid these thieves and book direct.EDIT SINCE GOTOGATE'S REPLY BELOW:Gotogate have confirmed they have received the refund from the airline as of 26th July. This has been corroborated by multiple staff members at Gotogate. Therefore the comment below regarding \"it takes __ to get the money back from the airline\" is irrelevant. The money is now in Gotogate's account and has been for two months - still, nowhere to be seen for me.It's a ridiculous response that goes to show their carelessness for customers. They clearly did not read my original review and just pasted a quick, easy and redundant answer.I hope their answer below confirms my warning to stay well clear of these crooks. | Rating: 1\n",

Wiz immediately processed my refund to GoToGate, the booking agent. However they denied this and said Wiz air had to transfer a refund to me personally, this was not true. After chasing GoToGate relentlessly (there is no phone number, all comms have to be over email), they responded 11 months later telling me I had to pay an admin fee for any refund and they gave ME bank details to transfer MORE funds into. GoToGate have a .co.uk email address however all customer service is outsourced to India. It has now been 15 months since my flight was cancelled and I haven't received a penny.This is possibly the worst company I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with.

Following the earthquake in Morocco, my flight with the airline needed to be cancelled/rescheduled. I called Go To Gate and found it disturbing they were asking me to contact the airline directly and request vouchers, given I had booked with Go To Gate not the Airline. Having called the airline they were extremely helpful, and advised I would have 15 days to reschedule and this information would be published soon on their website, which it was within 24 hours.What followed was what appears to me Go To Gate using my voucher for themselves. They refused to acknowledge the information in the airline website for all agents saying they'd 'email them'. This was strange given on my first call the excuse was the airline hadnt published anything. When they did, Gotogate decided it now required an email. I made over 20 calls requesting the 15 days grace to reschedule, they kept repeating what appeared to me to be  scripted lines and not even responding to my concerns above choosing to be silent and at the end repeating the same line again. I was also given assurances it'd be dealt with though I realised this would be highly unlikely given my experiences.As soon as the 15 days passer they magically called me and advised the time had passed.I travel frequently, and they will not be getting my business again in future. Essentially over £500 they have missed many more bookings worth alot more.

            "Page 303: Dear Gotogate Customer Service,Main Concern: Paid for Business class, refunded with economy class with unreasonable delays.I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the level of service provided regarding the refund process for my partner's cancelled flight with Air India on the 29th of July 2023. The ticket for this flight was booked via Booking.com, which ultimately involved your company, Gotogate.Below, I have outlined the sequence of events to provide clarity:- 29th July 2023: Flight cancelled by Air India. They confirmed 100% refund eligibility.- 30th July 2023: Contacted Gotogate for refund initiation. Assured processing had begun.- Approx. 14 days later: No refund received. On calling Gotogate, was informed the process would \"start now\".- Another 14 days: Was told by Gotogate that no refund was seen as approved by Air India. However, Air India reconfirmed a 100% refund approval from their end on 30th July.I took the initiative to bridge the communication gap between Air India and Gotogate, which resulted in a Gotogate representative acknowledging the refund approval. This highlights inefficiencies in your communication and internal processes.After an additional 16 days, I received an email from Booking.com indicating the approval of my refund, but only for 48% of the total amount paid. The refund I received only covered the initial cost of an economy ticket, neglecting the additional payment made for the upgrade to Business Class.Major Concerns:- Inadequate Communication: Clear gaps in communication between Gotogate and Air India resulted in extended delays.- Lack of Proactive Service: Gotogate representatives failed to take necessary actions without external intervention.- Incomplete Refund: Despite all the difficulties, the refund received is only partial, not recognizing the upgrade payment.The ordeal has caused significant inconvenience, both in terms of time and the emotional strain of navigating these complexities while managing personal and professional responsibilities.In this age of advanced technology, including AI, databases, and high-speed computing, such inconsistencies and inefficiencies in service are unexpected and unacceptable.I kindly request the following actions:- A thorough investigation into the discrepancies in the refund process.- Immediate processing of the balance refund, accounting for the Business Class upgrade payment.- An acknowledgment of the inconvenience caused, accompanied by a tangible solution to ensure such oversights are not repeated in the future.Your prompt attention to this matter will be greatly appreciated. I await your timely response.Sincerely,Impacted Customer[Update on 20th September 2023]: Gotogate reply to review states that I am fully compensated, but it is not true, I paid nearly 2172 Euro including upgrade to business class, but refund email only says 942 Euro will be refunded. I am still missing 1230 Euro for the Business class upgrade. This clearly shows that gotogate's accounting system has serious errors. I have confirmation from etraveli.com (a gotogate entity) on the Business class upgrade which was paid on 26th July, 2023.I would request Gotogate to look into this matter properly, or I have to use my receipts, tickets and ask EU or CZ Customer Protection agencies to raise a legal claim Dispute along with reasonable compensation for wasting time and efforts. | Rating: 1\n",

The flights were advertised with a clearly stated cancellation/refund option (the reason the flights were bought)and now GoToGate will not honour this. They are hiding behind airline rules as a third party when it is their group or booking.com's mistake for false advertising. The agent I spoke with refused to give me their last name, escalate the call to a manager or provide and address to direct complaints. The airlines cancellation rules were not available at the time of purchase only the \"dummy\" refund promise on the confirmation. This is false advertising and quite frankly stealing. There is no way to make a formal complaint except to physically write to their headoffices/CEO, go down a legal route or to report them to trading standards and action fraud in the UK. Their customer service contacts online divert you to the same office office and workers that have no authority and see no issue with the mis selling of airfare to customers.

The action originally also addressed Otravo that, however, ceased operations in December 2022.Following the dialogue, the online travel agencies made the following commitments:In case of cancelled flights, the online travel agencies will transfer refunds from the airline on to the consumer within 7 days from the day the online travel agency receives the refund from the airline. This will result in a refund in 14 days for consumers having bought their ticket through an online travel agency. Remaining backlogs in transferring refunds received from airlines have been or will be cleared by 30 June 2023 at the latestAs you can see Etraveli, the owner of GoToGate has committed to provide refunds.Basically GoToGate have not done what they promised the European Commission. | Rating: 1\n",

We’re sorry this may have added some stress to your experience and wanted to explain why this happened. Your booking was identified as having been made through a third-party agent who has no commercial relationship with Ryanair to sell our flights.Not only do third parties often add their own fees to our products but they also often provide their own payment and contact details. This means that in the unlikely event that your flight experiences a disruption, we are unable to contact or refund you directly. If you’d like to see if you were overcharged for your booking, you can use our price comparison tool here.Bookings made on the Ryanair website or App will allow you to easily manage all aspects of your trip and will not require verification. This is because we can be certain that we have obtained your correct contact details and, therefore, are aware of the relevant safety and security requirements.We’ve seen countless cases of our passengers facing difficulties that could have been avoided had the booking been made on the Ryanair website.We look forward to seeing you back on board soon.Kind Regards,The Ryanair Team | Rating: 1\n",

We’ve still not received the money, I have contacted them more than 12 times to explain the problem, the only e-mail I have had from them was to say they won’t refund a spent flight (I was asking for the fare difference from the downgrade not the full flight!).

Hours later got an email saying due to a system error the extra baggage could not be confirmed and that the checked baggage money would be refunded. When I tried to add the Checked baggage through Malaysian website the cost for it exceeded the original ticket price. Called Malaysian and they advised me that this was a scam and that they do receive a lot of these complaints. So called Gotogate a few times to resolve and the only sensible option they could give was to cancel the ticket because it was all within a few hours of the original booking. But they dicked me a so called handling fee.Looks like that this is a earn easy money tactic with some websites amidst some real ticket sales. Tough lesson learnt.Update on 18 Sep 2023: What made it worse was that not only the ticket had to be cancelled and I had to look elsewhere but the fact that there was a so called handling fee. This despite the fact that Gotogate were not able to provide what they had advertised and also that the cancellation was within the same day for which most websites don't charge any cancellation fee even if it was the customer who had changed his mind for whatever reason.

Asked them for a refund in June and until now I am just been told the issue has been escalated- this is all lies.I called the airline and they confirmed that have already refunded the amount on 20th August. And it's been over 15 days and I still am being told the airline has not refunded the amount to go to the gate. All lies! Gotogate on its website under its FAQsClaims that the average waiting time for a refund time is 6 days! I spend hours every week on the phone with Gotogate asking for my refund.This is now very stressful and frustrating for me. I will never use this company for any bookings in the future!Shame on you GotogateUpdate:Further adding to the misery thanks to Gotogate: I have now received an email dated 12-09-23 stating that the refund has been processed and I should receive my refund in the next 5 working days. Today is a working day no 8 and still no sign of return. Spoke to an agent who informed me that I should further wait for money! This company is nothing short of a joke. You are only lucky to book with them if there is no change/ delay in flight else you are stuck in a web full of lies by their agents. I am amazed at the audacity the agents have when they ask us to wait further when the email clearly states 5 working days! Approach this company only if you have too much peace in your life and want to add frustration and agony to it! Otherwise, avoid it at all costs! Better to be safe than sorry! | Rating: 1\n",

First they couldn't find a new ticket, then they had to remind me, oh yes, so we won't charge you a \"penalty\". Rebooked after much waiting, so I thought.Finally after paying the fare difference I was promised a follow up email. My previous flight was cancelled at the airline (the booking number is no longer valid), Go To Gate's page shows the old ticket and date. No follow up email, no booking apparently and now I'm out the original ticket price and the extra fee with no clue if I have a ticket or not.I say this service shouldn't exist because... they get these prices by buying tickets in bulk presumably. The reason I had to book with them in the first place is because, there was an internet error when I was attempting to book the same flight with the airline, and by the time I resolved it, someone else had booked it. I went to Booking.com and then booked through these crooks, where the same time and date I was looking for was available. Why? Of course because they had bought it up in bulk.

It is interesting to see how they only respond to positive reviews and not the negative ones which are plenty!Making changes to your booking is a nightmare even though flight amendments are allowed within ticket conditions. I was told by the customer rep that they are only allowed to check 2 viable other trip dates and if they are not suitable you have to interact with the airlines yourself to find a date to change to. Makes it fun when it is multiple airlines. Even if you interact with them you cannot change the booking directly and have to engage gotogate to do it. By the time you talk to all the different airlines and gotogate the flight dates and availability have most likely changed. So overall, an unachievable task. I gave up in the end. | Rating: 1\n",

We went there, paid the penalty and when we asked why we had to go in, they sent us somewhere else, which made it even more complicated for us to get to the plane on time.

I will never, NEVER book flights through booking.com again.  Their unresponsive and difficult customer service are deplorable.EDIT- We never actually got the flight confirmation from them. I had to take a morning out of our family vacation to go to the airport and have them search for our booking at the airline customer desk.  At no time did booking.com provide accurate information, and in fact told me that we had changed the ticket (we did not and have the receipt to prove it), and therefore we’re responsible to figure it out.

Booking a flight however, has been a complete disaster because they use Gotogate.My wife and I had to cancel our honeymoon due to a complication with pregnancy and the airline permitted a refund minus the cancellation fee. However, Gotogate and Booking.com just won't give us any information about the status of the refund. They claim the airline have not responded - but don't even give a rough indication as to how long we'll need to wait. It's now been about 6 months and still nothing.Multiple customer service advisers have said they've escalated it as urgent but nothing ever happens. They show little empathy to our situation, especially considering it's a considerable sum of money that we're out of pocket. Even if they just gave us a rough timeframe that is better than nothing, but they would prefer that we're left in limbo, getting anxiety in the process.Save yourself the hassle and DO NOT buy a flight through Gotogate who are used by Booking.com** Update 5/9/23**I contacted Skyscanner (where we originally found the flights that we'd booked) to let them know that Booking.com and Gotogate were treating us terribly and could my feedback be taken onboard to warn other customers. Amazingly, they contacted Booking.com & Gotogate for me requesting an urgent update and a few hours later Gotogate contacted me to say:'Regrettably, I discovered that the email address used for communication with the airline was incorrect. Consequently, I have re-submitted a full refund request to Qatar Airways.'So for nearly 6 months their customer service team have been contacting the airline for a refund but using the wrong email address! If this is the case then why did the emails not bounce? And why did no one from the airline tell them where to redirect them to? Perhaps they could be lying?

When I called a second time, the flight details and price were different, when I called a third time to find out what is correct, the third person told me there was a technical issue, I should call back in an hour. I then called the airline directly and rebooked with them, which was cancelled a few days before the rebooked flight, because they said, I had to go through the agency that issued the ticket.

One of the flights got changed (which I understand isn’t gotogates fault),  the customer service I received when trying to source an alternate flight was nothing less than terrible. I was then offered to cancel ‘free of charge’, which I did, and rebooked direct with the airlines. I was told that the refund process would take about 10 working days. After a month, I contacted the airline directly to start the refund process, as gotogate had not even started the process. I eventually received my refund today, but it took contacting gotogate everyday to get anything moving. And the CS team couldn’t care less. I’ll never darken their website again | Rating: 2\n",

Called TAP directly and not only they said I was entitled to the refund, but also said that they have no record of Gotogate ever requesting it to begin with!!They won't even share the TAP's refund refusal email or ROR code for me to check it directly with TAP.I've been on the phone with several different people from Gotogate, some said I can get a partial refund, then all of the sudden I no longer have a right to any refund at all... back to maybe we can get something... ridiculous!!An operator called Krishan from the front office was super unpleasant, refusing to pass me on to a manager or to escalate the issue (13-Aug 3:34PM). Basically told me to call again the same number, so that I'd be someone else's problem. I was speechless.They keep talking about policies, when my rights are protected by law, which overrules any policy.I was also told that in some cases the airlines themselves will have issued the refund already, and Gotogate helds the money/vouchers on their end whilst making it very difficult for customers to get it, in hopes that people will either give up or forget about the whole thing, and they get to keep it....bear in mind this is hearsay, but from what I'm experiencing, I honestly wouldn't be surprised.The bottom line is, IT'S NOT WORTH IT.

The seating map on the aircraft showed that the seat numbers I got would be the front rows. So looking at the aircraft map I purchased my seats worth $660 cdn. As we boarded the flights (going and coming) I saw that they were actually the second rows not first. I contacted gotogate about them false advertising the seats and asking for a refund but got refused.  If we were to sit in the second row seats then we didn’t have to specifically purchase the seats as we could have sat anywhere and saved that money. Please don’t purchase specific seats as their info is not correct/current. At the time of check in it’s better to ask the aircraft staff for your seats if available and save some money. I would never purchase any more tickets with gotogate and I advice others not to do it either. There are so many other websites/apps that can be honest and give better deals.

After booking tickets + paying extra fee for seats selection it turned out that seat selection was not a \"selection\" but just expressing the preferences. Let's read Gotogate T&C“3.1.2 As soon as your requested tickets have been issued, You will receive a confirmation email with a ticket number. This is the moment a binding contract between You and the relevant airline(s) has been concluded.3.1.3 Prices for the flight and seat availability are added directly in the Portal by the applicable airline. If changes are made by the airline that are outside of our control (e.g. price changes, seat availability or something else) and that occurs after a booking request has been made, but before the contract with the airline has become binding (as set out in Section 3.1.2 above), the contract will not enter into force and your payment will be refunded in full...\"Excerpt from gotogate->travel-conditions-> Booking processI got email from Gotogate and exact places I've selected.Next, I got email from airline with completely different seats.Ok, (to paraphrase T&C) apparently changes were made by the airline that are outside of Gotogate control and that occurred after a booking request has been made, and AFTER the contract with the airline has become binding.Contacting Gotogate support ended with reply that seat selection is just a preference, and you should contact airline to follow up your case.However, I checked my reservation at airline site, and it turned out that places I \"bought\" from Gotogate were available (they are still available at the moment I write this review, two days after the booking!)Moreover, seats were allocated not for passengers selected in Gotogate order but for an adult and a kid. Why? There is a family seating policy at airline that let you select seats for adult + kids for free if you select those seats in given section of the plane.I've paid extra money for specific seat selection and although they were available, the booking via Gotogate resulted in seats reservation that are available for free. It was not a fare limitation I can still select preferred seats with my tariff for 50% of cost Gotogate charged me with.You're still reading. It's not the end!Two days after booking I got notification that my tickets are blocked, as follows:Dear XXX this booking, XXYZZ, appears to have been made through a third-party travel agent who has no commercial relationship with airline to sell our flights. Therefore, airline has blocked this booking!...As third-party travel agents often do not provide airline with the correct passenger email address and payment details, we need to verify a passenger's identity before they can manage their booking and check-in online.airline needs to carry out this verification process in order to ensure we can comply with safety and security requirements.\"I went through online verification without problem- low additional cost is nothing compared with the procedure: you can feel like a person before they go behind the bars (look left, look right, close eyes)By the way, I found out that 3rd party agent had used their own cc number instead of mine.Happy ending, I contacted airline after verification and thanks to their assistance (good service experience!)

            "Page 333: Horrible company, we purchased our flights on July 31st, received confirmation from gotogate for our return flight home, but not the outbound flight and was told to wait 72 hours for the email confirmation. Today on the dot of 72 hours, received an email saying payment could not be processed, but still had the flight confirmed for return flight home. When contacting Gotogate by phone, we were told the bank declined the transaction, and when calling the bank, the bank said they did not decline the transaction, but that the company did not claim it and refunded the money at 72 hours on the dot. We checked our return flight confirmation and saw the credit card used was not our own, so Gotogate used their own card and did book our return flight home, just not our outbound flight and tried covering themselves by refunding the transaction all together and LIED that our bank declined it. This is absolutely ridiculous and the worst booking service EVER. They also didn't even refund me the full amount!!!

I paid the extra price to make sure I could cancel the flight in case I suddenly couldn’t go on the trip”. So then he says “yes sure, since you bought that extra option, you’ll get the full price of the ticket but not the price of the option to get a refund (the 200$ I mentioned)” which okay, I read it wouldn’t get refunded, and I would have preferred to lose 200$ instead of 800$, so I didn’t have an issue with that.Fast forward to a week later, I see a refund of 45$ in my account from the airline. I contact the assistance, and they tell me “sorry we can’t do anything. That’s what the airline policy says”.Turns out that they basically just ask for a refund on the airline site instead of you…all for the wonderful starting price of 200$. Idk if they send a golden flying pigeon with a hand written letter in order to request the refund, but this is a very sad strategy from them in order to make more money. I could have at least saved 200$.…In the end, I lost 1000$.This site is a scam.Pay a bit more, but don’t buy from them.

We have contacted BA and were informed that the travel agency has informed them this was the case for our travel, despite our tickets both from Booking.com and travel documents issued by this agency at the time of booking , clearly stating that baggage allowance included with return journey   I am appalled with the service as despite repeated communications to them via email and phone calls , there has been no resolution. The customer services on the other hand have behaved very dismissively to us , and have been looking into this for the past 3 weeks depsite repeated attempts to raise this issue with them, there has been no communication/ resolution.

YOU WILL THANK ME LATER!During Covid I realised that no matter the price, it was always best to book flights directly with the airline so that changes could be made quickly/efficiently.This time, I booked a return ticket from India to UK on Virgin using Go To Gate because the price was so cheap and I did not check reviews (my mistake!). I paid £672.99 by credit card.One week before the first flight, one of the Virgin flights was cancelled. This was not the fault of G2G. I believe everything would have been fine had the Virgin flight not been cancelled.I tried to reschedule the flight but after a number of calls to G2G, being on hold, getting \"disconnected\", being transferred to various \"departments\", I asked for a refund.10 days later I got a refund of £648.29, which was £24.70 less than I paid. I asked why this was and all G2G said was this was the refund they got from Virgin and for me to contact Virgin! Why should I do that?! I booked with G2G so surely they can tell me why I paid £672.99 but only got refunded £648.29.I asked for a refund invoice so I could see where the missing £24.70 had gone but no response. I have asked my credit card company to investigate.Compared to the unfortunate experience of others, I suppose I should be happy that I got most of my money back pretty quickly. However I am not happy about the missing £24.70 which G2G can't explain to me.I can guess that below, Go To Gate will respond with the standard copy paste about them wanting to help in future.

            "Page 340: My experience with Gotogate, a partner of Booking.com in Australia, has been nothing short of a frustrating journey. It all began when my booked flight, managed by Gotogate, was unexpectedly cancelled by the airline. I opted for a refund as per their provided options, but little did I know the ordeal that awaited me.From the start, communication with Gotogate was inconsistent and often vague. Despite my inquiries, I received generic responses that lacked specific details about the refund process. As the days turned into weeks, and the weeks into months, my frustration grew as I remained in the dark about the status of my refund.The lack of transparency and clear updates only added to my disappointment. I had expected Gotogate to be a reliable intermediary, but their handling of the refund process fell far short of my expectations. It left me feeling helpless and uncertain about when or if I would receive my hard-earned money back.As the delay continued, it caused significant financial strain. I had budgeted for the trip, and the prolonged wait for the refund left me scrambling to cover unexpected expenses. This added stress only exacerbated my feelings of frustration and disappointment.Attempts to escalate the matter and seek assistance from higher authorities yielded little results. It felt like my concerns were falling on deaf ears, and Gotogate's customer service appeared ill-equipped to handle the situation appropriately.In the end, the experience has left me feeling let down and upset. I had trusted Gotogate to handle my travel plans professionally, but their inability to follow proper procedures with the airline has shattered that trust completely.Overall, the entire process with Gotogate and SriLankan Airlines has been disheartening and emotionally draining. I hope sharing my experience serves as a warning to others to be cautious when using Gotogate's services and to consider alternative options for their travel needs.REPLY TO GOTOGATE RESPONSELike always stupid copy past reply from them.

What kind of scam is that?

So 7 hours prior to departure I started calling customer service asking them what was happening and I was repeatedly promised to not worry over the phone by CS that they will be sending me the boarding pass by email prior to departure.The boarding pass never arrived, and at no stage I was informed that the go to gate team was unable to do it for me. Now, 3 weeks later they tell me they are not allowed to do it for their customers!!!So I purchased a faulty product that included a free check-in and I had to pay for their mistakes and lies over the phone. And they refuse to refund me for a service they did not provide and I had to pay otherwise I could not fly. The check-in was never free, as they also told only today me that they are actually aware Ryanair doesn't allow these third-party tickets to be retrieved by customers and we should have paid the check-in service at go to gate in advance for them to send us the tickets!!!At no stage, I was told prior to departure that I had to pay a fee to be sent the boarding passes.You better refund me the money i had to pay or you are proof that you are just here to scam customers. | Rating: 1\n",

Tried checking in and only to be informed that I needed a transit visa for Germany. I asked and queried the office saying why would I need a transit visa when we ain’t leaving the airport, they were laughing and making jest and some of their agents even mentioned they are operating from the Pacific Ocean. Not realising how painful this is and the reason for the holiday which was to visit my mums graveyard since she passed on in February and couldn’t attend. I spoke with the German embassy and they weren’t helpful as well. I even asked if they offer like an ETA since it’s too late to apply for any visa from their consulate but they didn’t offer support. I would be taking this up with them and report this scam firm to the authorities here in the uk. I don’t know why they are still allowed to conduct operations despite the horrible experiences from people. Would share this on every social media platform to advise people against this scam and ensure their operations in the uk is completely grounded.

Booked a flight through them because we wanted to support an African airline Rwandan airlines who is also terrible now based on my recent interactions with them. Booked à flight, there was an issue with one connection. Called a day before to let them know. The agent I spoke to said to me, oh you we can't really do anything till you have actually missed the flight. I said really? He said I had to call after the flight had departed then they could reschedule me. TOTAL LIE, because I called them again the next day before the flight left to tell them that I had bought a whole new flight at à premium cost to get to jfk , and from jfk I thought I could get to dulles which was my departure airport. I got to jfk with jetblue at about 330am. Before clearing customs e.t.c it was about 430am. My flight from dulles was leaving dulles at 1110am. The only flight from jfk to Washington was to regan international which is still 35m from dulles. So go rent à car, to drive 4 1/2 hrs. Called gotogate.com again, to inform them that It's likely I won't make it to dulles before the 3hr checking for international flights requirement. Was ready to leave the airport in the rental, and I saw on the departure board that there was a flight from jfk to the same place I was supposed to fly to from Washington with the same airline. So I called gotogate.com again told them and offered to even pay the difference in price which was showing on line as 300+ usd. The agent said, go talk to qatar airlines and explain everything to them. I said why can't you do it, she said because you are already there and only the airline can do it. My flight was by Rwanda airlines but qatar airlines there partner was doing the first half of the flight. So to me it was straight forward, atleast I thought. Decided not to risk my life driving in the middle of the night, tired and I didn’t know which way, was just going to be at the mercy of g.p.s. Qatar airlines was not opening their jfk counter till 7, so I hoped for the best, returned the rental with a charge, and went to wait by qatar airlines counter at jfk.Qatar airlines opens and they said. \"Oh we don’t sell tickets or do ticket changes here. Your agent gotogate.com should know that. Then I realized what they where doing they were sending all over the place so they could steak my money. I called them back again, by this time I had spoken to them often had to be on hold, keep in mind it is long distance. I called them back again the 11th time, told them what qatar airlines said and the agent said oh how can I help you, I said can you check the notes on my account,  she said there were no notes. I said what, no notes?. She said call Rwanda airlines. ( Anyone reading this should try calling that terrible airline) and see. They have no international number, the number they have listed never has anyone answer. I called back gotogate.com again and now I was kept on hold for 29mins. Then the person came on and said oh sorry we won't refund you because you missed your flight.Ref: MCPYZB as requested.These guys believe they can keep getting away with stealing from people.

They are a terrible company to deal with and have given me conflicting information about cancellation fees. All of their messages which are sent in reply to queries made via Booking.com are automated, i.e. generated by a machine (probably Chat-GPT). They confirmed this in a phone call when they explained why their messages was saying the cancellation fee is £150 per passenger, yet on the phone it is £300 per passenger. Then, most recently, they have told me it is £350 per passenger, after the customer rep spoke to a 'supervisor'. This is despite, when looking at Air India's fare rules, it saying that the fee is £150 per passenger and the same being confirmed when I spoke with an Air India customer rep on the phone (I also recorded the phone call so I have the evidence).I wish I had booked direct with the airline, Air India. I will NEVER use GoToGate again. It is not worth a small discount in the fare. Book DIRECT with the airline. Don't subject yourself to the huge stress in talking with these GTG people and risk being scammed. Booking.com play no part in the communication - all links to 'Help and Support' via their website are to the phone number and messaging service of GTG.

After talking to the airline I received information that is mostly reassuring.I have read gotogate reply and although polite it does not change my experience. I wouldn’t have been able to cancel my flight and get answers in the time allowed for cancelling but the false advertising of a 24 hour cancellation policy and the time it takes to contact representatives (and them being without the knowledge required) will keep me away from using this platform again - it doesn’t provide the peace of mind that is essential to making travel plans and for travel in general. | Rating: 1\n",

So the child would have to travel alone, which is not possible.Then the booking for the adult was completely lost. Since the child cannot travel alone, this renders both tickets unusable.Gotogate does not reply to emails properly. Their response consists of ‘we need permission to process your details’, then ‘we need your booking details’ (which you already provided, of course), then ‘we need the airline’s permission to alter your flight’ etc. It goes on and on like that. Then no solution in the end.When calling, be prepared to wait forever: first 45 minutes wait to talk to someone, then this person says 'I have to ask my supervisor' for which you're put on hold again for an hour, then the supervisor comes on the phone and puts you on hold again for 45 minutes etc. The result: several calls of 4-5 hours length (!!!!) and no solution. Mind you, these are international calls to Finland, with the appropriate price tag. In the end they just put you on hold forever (more than 2 hours on hold) until you give up and hang up the phone.

When getting in touch with GoToGate the customer service chat was incredibly slow (over an hour to respond) and repeatedly tried to get  me to accept to a refund, which was absolutely useless as I had already booked accommodation and other stuff, and the flights had gone up by more than £400. After chatting for hours they could do nothing for me and did not help me get a new flight, just said to go to the airline as they were not responsible... Absolutely useless and terrible service.

            "Page 345: I recently booked a flight through Gotogate.co.uk in partnership with Booking.com (Booking Order number: 40-381575513) for a trip on 1st July. However, my experience with this company has been nothing short of a nightmare.From the moment I made the booking until the day of the flight, I attempted to make changes by contacting Gotogate customer care more than 20 times. Shockingly, they were utterly unhelpful and simply advised me to contact Qatar Airways. But even Qatar Airways couldn't make any changes because Gotogate.co.uk had booked my flight with a promotional fare.Frustrated, I decided to cancel the flight and contacted customer care to inquire about the penalty for cancellation. Initially, I was informed that the penalty would be £58. However, just two days before the flight, when I called to confirm the cancellation penalty, I was informed that it would be £109. But to my astonishment, when I actually canceled the flight prior to departure, they charged me a whopping £189. When I questioned them about this sudden increase, they casually mentioned that the fee was higher because I cancelled within 3 hours of departure. This information was never conveyed to me beforehand. Instead, I was assured that the penalty would be £109 regardless of the timing of cancellation.I attempted to escalate the issue by contacting the higher authorities and requested to listen to the audio recordings of our previous conversations, but I received no response whatsoever. Now, I am left with no choice but to consider filing a formal complaint with the police if I do not receive a proper response from them. It is alarming how they continue to shift blame onto the airlines for fare increases while their customer care remains utterly helpless.I received an email stating that an airline cancellation fee of GBP 189 per person would be deducted from my refund on Jul 1, 2023, and I am yet to receive any refund from them.In summary, my experience with Gotogate.co.uk has been absolutely horrendous. I strongly advise against using their services or booking through Booking.com. They provide no assistance, mislead customers with incorrect information, and are unresponsive to complaints. Save yourself the stress and frustration by avoiding this company altogether. | Rating: 1\n",

The journey was meant to take place in August 2023.In April 2023, I received an email where you notified me that you changed the trip itinerary without my consent. The new itinerary did not fit my plans at all and I requested change. From April 2023 to May 2023 I went through several calls with your customer service, wasting time and energy trying to get you to solve the problem. I was promised many times that you would find a new itinerary that could fit my interest. During this time, you even dared to charge me additional money to change my itinerary. I was patient and waited and got no new itinerary.After trying many times and seeing that you had no interest in solving the problem, on the 18th of May 2023 I requested a refund, got a confirmation of this by email and I was told on the phone that this process could take up to 1 month time to be solved. During June and July I have been contacting you again several times, as I still haven't received any update about the refund  and its been almost two months since I requested it. Every time I call on the phone to request information about the refund, I am told different stories about why it is not solved yet, which are probably just lies. The journey date is next month, the tickets cost over 7000dkk  and I need to buy a new ticket with another agency as yours is the worst ever.

The original price for the flight was way cheaper than that. I also had to call 3 times to get that information and spent around $40 on phone credit calling from Peru. I’d been told the first two calls that there wasn’t anyone in the office that had system access to change my flight. Seriously? To simply change a flight? And that despite calling during UK office hours. Absolute joke. Never using them again. | Rating: 1\n",

However, it is now July 6th, and I have yet to receive the promised refund. This prolonged delay is completely unacceptable and goes beyond any reasonable timeframe for a refund. I am deeply disappointed, as I have never encountered such a prolonged wait for a refund, especially considering the circumstances in which I was forced to purchase a new ticket out of my own pocket, costing me ove £600.

            "Page 349: Title: Falling Short of Expectations: A Cautionary Tale of Using GoToGateRating: ★☆☆Initially, GoToGate served as a convenient platform for booking airline tickets due to competitive pricing and user-friendly design. However, a recent experience has greatly undermined my confidence in their services.When a friend contracted COVID-19 and was unable to travel, GoToGate's customer service proved to be severely disappointing. Despite the clear impact of the pandemic, the company demonstrated a lack of flexibility and empathy, failing to offer any assistance in adjusting travel plans.After this event, I learned that other users also faced similar challenges. Therefore, I cannot recommend GoToGate anymore. The savings they offer aren't worth the potential risk and stress you could face in a crisis. Consider using more reliable alternatives. | Rating: 1\n",

            "Page 350: Booked a long-awaited holiday to Japan via Booking.com. Before we flew, I checked my documents and became concerned that I didn't have any baggage allowance for the return flight, so I queried this but was reassured that I did indeed have the same allowance for both flights. On booking in for the flight home, we were informed my suspicion had been right, and there was no baggage allowance for the journey. I showed the agent the email conversation where it confirmed we did have it, but obviously they have no power to overrule it so understandably I had to pay for it there and then.Registered a claim shortly after we got home, which was answered very quickly and I was informed that a system error had deleted the baggage allowance from the journey. They requested confirmation of the baggage charge, which I sent in and received a prompt response through GoToGate that they would honour it and credit me shortly. I was very happy with how efficiently this had gone. A couple of weeks later, there was no sign of the refund, so I wrote back to request an update. Then two weeks later. Then a month later.... This has been going on since January and we're now in July! Each and every time I have had a formulaic response just asking me to be patient - well I'm sorry, but my patience is more than used up! It was not a small amount of money to be shelling out after a trip like that, especially right before Christmas.
