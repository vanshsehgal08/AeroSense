"Flight was cancelled and no refund provided. Has been 4 months and have had to ring go to gate over 10 times. I get the same answer of ‘the money will go into your account in two days’ but nothing, this is after being constantly put on hold and being on the phone over an hour to them. I would highly recommend to not use them as if something does go wrong they are not interested in sorting it out for you. Very close to a scam company.",1,Negative,flight cancel refund provide month ring go gate time get answer money go account two day nothing constantly put hold phone hour would highly recommend use something go wrong interested sort close scam company

"I had one of the worst travel experiences ever thanks to GoToGate. We nearly missed our flight due to an absurdly long and poorly planned connection. For over an hour, we had to run with our luggage—through a bus transfer, a train, immigration, passport control, and two security checks.The distance from the arrival gate to the departure gate was completely unreasonable. There was zero support, no clear guidance, and no one to help. It was a nightmare, especially for anyone elderly or traveling with kids.This kind of disorganization is unacceptable. I won’t be using GoToGate again, and I strongly advise others to stay away.",1,Negative,one bad travel experience ever thank gotogate nearly miss flight due absurdly long poorly plan connection hour run luggagethrough bus transfer train immigration passport control two security checksthe distance arrival gate departure gate completely unreasonable zero support clear guidance one help nightmare especially anyone elderly travel kidsthis kind disorganization unacceptable will not use gotogate strongly advise other stay away

"I booked a return flight through GoToGate for 13 April 2025 with Wizz Air. The travel document clearly stated a 01:40 departure from Jeddah to London. When I arrived at the airport, I was informed the flight had been moved to 12 April — a day earlier — and that I had missed it.Wizz Air advised that GoToGate requested the change.I was never informed.No email. No SMS. Nothing.GoToGate now claims they did notify me — yet I have reviewed every single message, folder, and account. There is no evidence. I have asked them to provide proof, but so far, silence.This isn’t just a missed flight. It’s a breakdown in basic duty of care. When you operate in the travel industry, communication is everything. I was left stranded in another country because of GoToGate’s failure to notify me of a change they requested.I have since raised a dispute with my bank, but the burden should not fall on customers to chase answers after being let down.If you're considering booking through GoToGate — I strongly urge you to reconsider.",1,Negative,book return flight gotogate april wizz air travel document clearly state departure jeddah london arrive airport inform flight move april day early miss itwizz air advise gotogate request changei never informedno email sms nothinggotogate claim notify yet review every single message folder account evidence ask provide proof far silencethis be not miss flight breakdown basic duty care operate travel industry communication everything leave strand another country gotogate failure notify change requestedi since raise dispute bank burden fall customer chase answer let downif you re consider book gotogate strongly urge reconsider

"We were mis-sold long haul seats and luggage. Just hours after paying for the booking we received a 'jolly' email from G2G that our seats were safe but the luggage booking was cancelled due to 'technical reasons'.

G2G customer services blamed the large international airline for not keeping G2G up to date. It isn't up to G2G to keep their product sales up-to-date apparently.It is costing us more to pay for hold luggage at check-in, it would have been cheaper to book direct which we will do in future.

"I booked 4 tickets from London to Toronto based on their advertisement that included luggage. After payment, I received an email stating there was a ""technical problem"" and they couldn't include luggage as advertised, blaming Air Canada. They offered a refund if luggage was essential, so I canceled. They mentioned a £35 handling fee per ticket, which should have been £140, but my refund was short by £164.This company lures customers in with low prices, then adds hidden fees when you cancel due to their false advertising.

"We cancelled our VietJet Air flight through Booking (managed by GoToGate), and a travel voucher of around €360 was issued. We simply wanted to use that voucher to book two new flights (a 1-hour domestic flight and a 3-hour international flight), whose total cost was well within the value of the voucher.Yet GoToGate made the process completely impossible:	•	Refused to share the voucher with us directly	•	Forced us to go through their customer service for any rebooking	•	No transparency about the actual flight prices	•	They asked for over €1,000 for flights that we could see cost no more than €411 total without giving us the amount of the flight, only a link for us to pay extra Every exchange was confusing and contradictory. We received vague and often nonsensical answers. No breakdown of the costs. No clear communication.After over a month of going in circles, we were forced to buy new tickets on our own. We then requested a refund — first they said it was in progress, then said it wasn’t possible, then told us again to use the voucher… It’s never-ending nonsense.We are now demanding a full and immediate refund, because this entire situation was caused by their blatant mismanagement.GoToGate should be avoided at all costs. Their customer service is nonexistent, their practices are opaque, and the overall experience has been unacceptable.At this point, their behavior borders on illegality, and the way this company operates feels more like organized fraud than a serious travel agency.I had to post this again to insert my order number 40-674986360",1,Negative,cancel vietjet air flight booking manage gotogate travel voucher around issue simply want use voucher book two new flight hour domestic flight hour international flight whose total cost well within value voucheryet gotogate make process completely impossible refuse share voucher we directly force we go customer service rebooke transparency actual flight price ask flight could see cost total without give we amount flight link we pay extra every exchange confuse contradictory receive vague often nonsensical answer breakdown cost clear communicationafter month go circle force buy new ticket request refund first say progress say be not possible tell we use voucher neverending nonsensewe demand full immediate refund entire situation cause blatant mismanagementgotogate avoid cost customer service nonexistent practice opaque overall experience unacceptableat point behavior border illegality way company operate feel like organized fraud serious travel agencyi post insert order number

"USLESS, POINTLESS, MIDDLE MAN COMPANY - AVOID! I'd give 0 stars if I could. I booked return flights to Ibiza with EasyJet via Go To Gate, 9mths in advance. With 3mths to go, EasyJet changed the flight times and departing airport. I told Go To Gate I could not accept the change (they were cutting my 3 day trip short by a whole day!) and wanted a full refund. They said it would be 10 working days. After 10 days they'd only refunded my outbound flight (£350). I called for an update and they said they were waiting for EasyJet to refund them and then I'd be refunded. I had to contact them a further 4 times over a 3 week period for the remining £600 I was owed. Each time I was told that there was nobody in their refunds team that I could speak to and I'd have to just keep waiting. In the end I checked EasyJet's website and could see my inbound flights had been rebooked on the 9am flight I did not agree to! After 2 more calls to Go To Gate, and no resolution, I contacted EasyJet and they were able to cancel the booking and refund my money, within 30mins. Annoyingly the refund had to go via Go To Gate who then took a further 3 days to credit me. All in all I had to wait 1 month for what was supposed to be a 10 day refund, chase this AWFUL company several times and eventually do their job for them and contact the airline myself.

"Very very bad - do not ever use them. I booked a multi trip and it gave me a price, then at the payment screen it was $1000 more. I will never use again.Added this after seeing Gotogate's reply to my review. This has never happened on any other flight booking website and I have booked many flights on many website, in fact I have visited every country in Europe plus more. Plus it was not a minor change, $1000 is not minor. Plus this change of price happen 10 seconds after Gotogate gave me the supposed real price from the airline, how could the price of flights change by $1000 in 10 seconds??? This is a scam!!! Stay clear of them. I went back to do a search on the same flights, how come other websites offered the same flights for $1000 less. Other reviewers said the same thing happened to them with Gotogate. Run and run fast!!!

"If I could give zero stars, I would. My experience with Gotogate has been nothing but frustrating and disappointing. It’s now been over seven months, and I’m still waiting for my $1,100 CAD refund for a canceled return flight. At first, they refunded only $74.90 CAD and admitted it was their own internal mistake. They assured me it had been escalated and would be resolved—but that was months ago. Since then, I’ve been stuck in a loop of empty reassurances and absolutely no progress.Then on March 29 they sent me an email that they no longer had my payment information because I had supposedly changed banks (I didn’t). Even though they already had my credit card information, I submitted my banking info immediately again using their link and still, nothing.This company is a complete mess. There’s no accountability, no urgency, and no respect for customers. If you value your time, money, or sanity, book elsewhere.

Bookingreference: 40-688971424   We booked at Booking.com flights with Vueling from Amsterdam to Valencia and back and added cabin luggage for both flights. The booking was carried out by Gotogate and they cancelled our luggage from Valencia to Amsterdam 'due to technical problems'.  Apparantly there were only technical problems on the second flight and not on the first flight. And so they only refunded the payment for the luggage on the second flight. When I tried to book cabin luggage directly at Vueling for the trip from Valencia to Amsterdam it appeared that it is not possible to book for only one way. So now we have to pay double. I think they make it their core business to rip you of.,1,Negative,bookingreference book bookingcom flight vuele amsterdam valencia back add cabin luggage flight booking carry gotogate cancel luggage valencia amsterdam due technical problem apparantly technical problem second flight first flight refunded payment luggage second flight try book cabin luggage directly vuele trip valencia amsterdam appear possible book one way pay double think make core business rip

"I’m deeply disappointed by my recent experience with Gotogate and feel compelled to share this to help others avoid the same ordeal.On April 5 2025, I was scheduled to travel from Sydney to Dubai via Singapore with flights booked through Gotogate — Scoot (TR3) from Sydney to Singapore and Emirates from Singapore to Dubai. Gotogate offered this itinerary under its Self-Transfer Guarantee, which claims to protect customers in case of missed connections.Scoot was delayed by over 90 minutes, landing in Singapore at 8:16 PM instead of the scheduled 7:00 PM. My connecting Emirates flight to Dubai was at 9:00 PM. Despite doing everything I could — including booking a seat near the aircraft door to exit quickly — I missed the flight due to immigration delays and baggage collection. I reached the Emirates counter at 9:20 PM, only to find the gate closed.With no assistance from Gotogate at that critical moment, I had no choice but to book another Emirates flight departing at 12:50 AM at huge amount of money.Despite Gotogate’s Self-Transfer Guarantee promising to assist in such cases, I’ve been repeatedly told that I will only be refunded the original ticket price (a fraction of what I paid for the last-minute booking). I’ve been passed around by multiple agents, with no meaningful resolutionThis has caused immense stress and financial loss. What’s even more frustrating is that I did everything by the book and trusted Gotogate’s guarantee — only to be let down. This experience makes me question the credibility of their Self-Transfer policy, which now feels more like a marketing gimmick than a real customer safeguard.I sincerely urge Gotogate to do the right thing and refund the full cost of my rebooking as per their stated policy.To the Gotogate team: please escalate this to a senior manager who can act with fairness and integrity.To fellow travelers: be extremely cautious booking through Gotogate, especially when dealing with tight connections.

"As requested, I'm providing my feedback regarding my recent experience. I have booked with this site before and was pleased with their follow-up and overall service. However, this time, I found it challenging to navigate the website. I had to leave the site multiple times to find that the information provided was inaccurate. The checked baggage policies should be clearer and prominently displayed from the start. It’s frustrating to see one price initially, only to have additional charges added later on. This approach leads customers to compare prices with other providers to find better deals. It's reasonable to assume that most travellers will need more than just a handbag, as emergencies can arise, but they are not the norm. Therefore, I kindly request that the information be presented more straightforwardly, without ambiguity. Thank you for taking the time to read my message.

"I had a truly disappointing experience with GoToGate and strongly advise others to book directly with airlines rather than using this agency.I booked a flight that included a Wizz Air segment through GoToGate. I was later charged €47 at the airport check-in desk because I supposedly failed to check in online. However, I was never given the airline booking reference or informed of the need to check in online at least 3 hours before the flight to avoid the fees.Worse still, GoToGate used a fake proxy email address (like myname1 at dynamicbestaccess) to communicate with Wizz Air—meaning I received no email notifications or check-in reminders from the airline. I only found out this was the reason after paying the fee and investigating the issue myself.When I contacted GoToGate, they refused to take any responsibility, stating their only role was ""ticketing"" and that I should contact the airline—despite the fact that they booked it on my behalf and blocked communication from the airline by using my fake email. Their customer service was dismissive, and completely unwilling to help. They kept repeating canned responses and refused to escalate the complaint meaningfully.This would have been 100% avoidable if GoToGate had done what any decent agency should:- Provide access to airline check-in- Use the customer's actual email- Share the correct booking detailsI will never use GoToGate again, and I highly recommend others stay away to avoid unexpected costs, zero accountability, and frustrating service.",1,Negative,truly disappointing experience gotogate strongly advise other book directly airline rather use agencyi book flight include wizz air segment gotogate later charge airport checkin desk supposedly fail check online however never give airline booking reference inform need check online least hour flight avoid feesworse still gotogate use fake proxy email address like myname dynamicbestaccess communicate wizz airmeaning receive email notification checkin reminder airline find reason pay fee investigate issue myselfwhen contact gotogate refuse take responsibility state role ticket contact airlinedespite fact book behalf block communication airline use fake email customer service dismissive completely unwilling help keep repeat can response refuse escalate complaint meaningfullythis would avoidable gotogate do decent agency provide access airline checkin use customer actual email share correct booking detailsi never use gotogate highly recommend other stay away avoid unexpected cost zero accountability frustrating service
I would avoid using gotogate at any cost.  I had the worst experience and still going back and fourth to resolve an issue from last summer.  My son broke his elbow the day of our return flight and after being told we could change the flight they suddenly changed their mind and said it was too late despite it being hours before boarding.  The ticketing airline confirmed it was possible but they made it incredibly difficult and dragged out the process until the flight departed whilst my son was in emergency surgery.  I have show proof of his accident and yet months later they refuse to refund that leg of the journey despite the ticketing airline (Virgin) confirming it is ok to do so.  The costumer service has been appalling.

"I’m writing this post to share my ongoing and extremely frustrating experience with @Gotogate and its parent company @Etraveli. I booked four flights for my girlfriend and me—three of which were executed flawlessly. However, the fourth flight underwent an unexpected schedule change that would have delayed our arrival by a day.After contacting support about this change, I was informed that a same-day flight wasn’t available and that I needed to initiate a refund in order to even get an estimated refund amount. When I pointed out that this process was unacceptable, support agreed to open a request to inquire about the refund amount without immediately cancelling the flight. Despite this agreement—and with screenshots as proof—they went ahead and initiated a refund, effectively cancelling my flight.For the past six weeks, I have been in continuous contact through calls and web chats. There was even a moment when it appeared we might reach a resolution, as I received an offer for an alternative flight. Unfortunately, my follow-up email was ignored, and I have written confirmation from support that no action was taken on my reply.With only two days remaining until my scheduled departure, I feel compelled to publicly share this experience. I hope that by bringing this issue to light, @Mathius Hedland and the leadership at Gotogate and Etraveli will take immediate action to improve their customer service and ensure that no one else experiences such unprofessional handling of their travel plans.UPDATE! They booked us a new flight and cancelled that too. 10 hours from the departure date the customer service representative tells us to contact the airline ourselves, whilst simultaneously admitting gotogates guilt. All recorded. If we did not call, because we no longer trust them, we would have got up at 5am tomorrow morning, got to the airport and been told that we weren't on the flight. Absolutely unbelievable.Update on gotogates reply:Yes the airline changed the schedule as I said in my situation above, but gotogate are the one that cancelled without my approval. They have said I had the flight rebooked and once again it was cancelled, if it existed at all. Talking to support again at 130am in the morning there is no flight for us and we have had to book our own. Instigating a refund and compensation procedures.

I went back to the website and the advertised price is still AED1.9k/£400. I notified customer services via web chat and email and phone within 1 hour of booking to request a cancellation. They replied that basically it was tough as prices can fluctuate. What a joke! They also responded in their messages will smiley faces and an offer to cancel the booking but not refund me?! I also spoke to the airline who basically said it’s Gotogates booking error not an airline issue.

Finally contact via booking.com chat function where they say that we are still scheduled for the original rescheduling. I am very confused and ask to be changed to the second change.

"I booked a flight through booking.com which i wanted to change at the last minute. I was sceptical when I realised that booking outsource to gotogate, but they got in contact with me within 24 hours and changed the flight for a nominal fee. I checked the fee for changing flights direct with the airline and it was the same price. Maybe the service was efficient cos it was via booking.com, I don't know.

"Even one star is more for them. Rubbish site to book the tickets. They scammed me, It was mentioned I can add the laggage after booking. When tried there was no option. It was two connecting flights. Air india and jetstar. total cost 1427$. And oncall luggage addition cost 1200$. When requested to cancel the ticket they said I will get 100%refund. They failed to refund or cancel jetstar and only 700$ given. Customer service team was not polite and not ready to sort it out either. All were asian people on call and never behaved politely. Stay away from this site. Rebooked the same flight and got 25kg laggage in the same cost.Story did not end here- contacted gotogate multiple times to get reassurance in case they miss the flight because the time to board second flight from singapore was only 1.5 hrs and terminal 4 was far apart. So, parents missed the flight, was on call for 2-3 hours on 10april 2025. Multiple team members kept on transfering the call and some promised refund. Recordings should be available with gotogate. Finally one person said as passengers are at airport we have escalated the case and enquiring with airline to sort out.Later at 1 am on 11 april contacted but one lady said case will take time to solve. Then i had to book another flight (immedietely) to bring parents home.

"Never issued my refund for a canceled flight due to strikes in Germany. Kept bouncing me back to Lufthansa. Lufthansa said, and I quote: “What Gotogate is doing is unethical and even illegal.

"I am from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. I departed with China Eastern (Booked via Gotogate) to go to Budapest to visit my girlfriend, departed 13th Feb, landed at 14th Feb.Flights were:MU8592 (KUL-PVG)(Transfer at PVG)MU8639 (PVG-BUD)MU8640 (BUD-PVG)(Transfer at PVG)MU6021 (PVG-KUL)I was supposed to fly home, at 17th March, but Gotogate's system said and I quote: ""Your booking has been changed, Please check your email to confirm your updated trip."" and ""Your reservation has been changed"".I had NO email sent to me, still untill now, just nothing! I was denied at checkin due to this discrepency of information about the ticket, and they told me to contact Gotogate about what this could be, as my flight may have been moved to a different date.Called them, they said I wasn't moved to a different date, and to please call the airline. I called the airline, guess what? They told me ""We cannot handle your booking, please contact your travel agency"", and this was repeated back and forth passing responsibilities...back to back to back..for 10 days.I even sent both companies screenshots of the error, and finally at the 26th of March, I received a formal email from the Kuala Lumpur Office at China Eastern Airlines about my voluntary reschedule.They said and I quote:""Thank you for contacting China Eastern Airlines Kuala Lumpur Branch. We have received your complaint regarding your voluntary ticket change to the same flight on Apr 2nd. To proceed with your rebooking request, you need to come to our office in person so that we can verify your passport details and collect any applicable charges. This is because your ticket is issued via a third-party travel agency, and unfortunately, we are unable to proceed with this kind of request online at this moment. I understand that you are currently outside Malaysia. Givin this, we would suggest that you contact the travel agency directly to assist with your flight change request. Meanwhile, I have forwarded your complaint about the travel agency to our OTA team for review. Should you have any further queries, feel free to reply to this email.""I would like to repeat, that email, was literally at the 26th of march. That's 9 days already, and no response, I gave a response via call, i was expected a response via call too, nothing. No call, no email.Contacted Gotogate at the 27th and finally they started ""working"" on my case. I have been promised a response within 24 hours...24 hours has passed, no response. I kept calling every single day, till now, no response...So I visited the ECC's office in budapest, to get some help possibly, I managed to talk to one of the higherups or employees? I dont know, she referred him as her boss or something?Yeah, I talked to him and explained my situation, even called gotogate in front of him and let him hear it and yeah... Dissapointing. He said there is unfortunately, nothing I can do now besides file a report that involves the law or something, but unfortunately I will still have to keep waiting. I didn't file that yet, because he told me if i want to file with ECC first then this case has to be going on for a month before I can file this claim, so I just waited...Called gotogate today and I just got a response, saying if I want to report this team and claim compensation for the mishandling of my case, I can file some report form with them...which may take a few days or even upto 2 weeks to receive a response! I did it, so. Yeah. I'm stuck here still. I even called my embassy but unfortunately, they cannot help, as they only assist in...i dont know what matters...they count my matter as a ""personal matter"" so it doesnt count...I have to go home...I have to attend multiple medical appointments/procedures, due to my mix of depression/anxiety/sleep issues/potential autism (as said by doctor, its possible, but not sure yet.) I have been taking antidepressants (Fluvox 100mg)  but they do nothing besides worsen the affects...so i stopped taking them and yeah, as expected I didn't receive any side effects cuz this literally didnt do anything for me. I have a kitten thats a few months old that I have to take care of...And I have more medical issues too which i need to get sorted out, cheilitis which is i dont know what kind, but normal medicines/treatments never worked so it requires further examination/testing, dandruff issues which some normal medicines/over the counter treatments/dandruff shampoos dont work that still need further examination and lately been having some heart irregularities sometimes...so yeah...I am not willing to use healthcare here, as it is significantly more expensive, and government healthcare is literally free in my home country, malaysia. covering everything if you're a citizen.

"In short, I have booked 4 flights with luggage included on one of them, got to the airport and, while dropping my luggage, was informed by the airline that no luggage was included (despite being charged for one and showing them at the counter the evidence of that). As a result, I was left with no option than to pay for the luggage at the counter (at a higher rate) and advised by the airline to reach back to Gotogate (who made the original booking with luggage). As a result, I went back to Gotogate for the refund. The mistake was immediately acknowledge but I only got refunded the value charged during the booking, rather than what I have paid in the counter due to Gotogate mistake. Again, the issue has been acknowledged but them I was told that nothing else could be done. In essence, the same as saying, we know that you have been a Booking.com (the provider originally used) customer for almost 20 years, we acknowledge we have messed up, caused a lot of inconvenience but rather prefer ignore all of that on the back of a 24 Euros difference (which for me, its fundamentally a matter of principle). On top of that their customer service was absolutely incapable of dealing with the issue as well. I thought was dealing with an AI agent. Not going to use this provider anymore.- Update -After this post, Gotogate reached out to me asking to re-submit the request so that it could be finally addressed. Silly me, I have decided to give them a final chance to make things right just to get an automated response 6 minutes later outlining that nothing can be done and the case has been closed again.

"Terrible IT and even worst support.I had two of the worst customer service experiences with gotogate. First I had a voucher from a previous booking. When trying to use it the voucher simply didn’t go through. Although IT acknowledged there was a technical issue, they didn’t find it appropriate to refund me, just to fix the voucher and tell me it will work “next time”. Fine. So I booked again from them. This time the voucher worked. Later however I had to change the flight date. This is possible according to the ticket terms. However, support said there are no flights available for the date I need. I look in *gotogate* website, and I see about 12 available departures I can change to. But still support says they are not available. I insist and ask them to check if there is a technical issue. They hang up the chat. Would avoid booking from gotogate even if the cost is 25% more.",1,Negative,terrible even worst supporti two bad customer service experience gotogate first voucher previous booking try use voucher simply do not go although acknowledge technical issue do not find appropriate refund fix voucher tell work next time fine book time voucher work later however change flight date possible accord ticket term however support say flight available date need look gotogate website see available departure change still support say available insist ask check technical issue hang chat would avoid book gotogate even cost

As a result of the Heathrow closure on the 21st of March 2025 China Eastern cancelled my flights to Shangai (PVG) and Tokyo.

"I had an extremely frustrating experience with Gotogate, and I strongly advise against booking with them.I purchased a flexible ticket in June 2024, expecting that I could change my flight if needed. When I requested a change in February 2025, it was processed, but then I noticed my middle name was missing on the ticket. I followed their process for a name correction and paid the required fee.After paying, Gotogate randomly demanded an additional payment without explanation. I challenged this, and after multiple calls and inconsistent responses from different agents, they finally confirmed my ticket was released without extra fees.Later, the airline changed my flight, and I had to adjust my return date. Gotogate confirmed my name correction and the new flight date multiple times. However, weeks passed, and every time I called, they gave me conflicting information or ignored my case.The worst part? After two months of waiting, I discovered that Gotogate never even submitted my name correction request to the airline! Their customer service lied to me multiple times, giving me false hope while wasting my time and causing me extreme stress.Now, they are offering me a partial refund but refusing to refund fees for services they never properly provided. I have all the proof of their misleading communication and will escalate this case legally.If you value honest customer service, transparency, and your peace of mind, DO NOT BOOK with Gotogate.

"Achtung – Extrem unseriös durch Booking & Gotogate!Ich habe über Booking einen Flug gebucht (abgewickelt über Gotogate), bezahlt – doch die Tickets wurden nie ordnungsgemäß ausgestellt. Am Flughafen wurde mir der Check-in verweigert. Stehe 4 Uhr nachts am Flughafen - Flug verpasst, Geld weg, Kundenservice lügt, selbstständig neuen Flug für erheblich mehr Kosten gebucht. Was danach kam, war ein absoluter Albtraum: Der Kundenservice von Booking und Gotogate hat mich belogen, hingehalten und mit allen Mitteln versucht, mich von einer Rückerstattung und abzubringen. Offensichtliches Ziel: Zeit schinden, bis der Kunde aufgibt. Ein faires Verhalten? Fehlanzeige.Wichtiger Rat an alle Betroffenen:Lasst euch nichts am Telefon erzählen – besteht auf schriftliche Kommunikation. Sichert alle Beweise, kontaktiert sofort eure Bank für eine Rückbuchung und schaltet die Schlichtungsstelle für den öffentlichen Verkehr ein. Ohne massiven Druck bekommt ihr keinen Cent zurück. Wer kann, sollte auch rechtliche Schritte prüfen – freiwillig zahlen sie nichts.Fazit:Booking & Gotogate sind unzuverlässig, intransparent und kundenfeindlich. Hände weg! Ich buche dort nie wieder – und kann nur jeden davor warnen, den gleichen Fehler zu machen.English:I booked a flight via Booking (handled through Gotogate), paid in full – but the tickets were never properly issued. At 4 AM I was standing at the airport, unable to check in. Flight missed, money gone. The customer service lied to me, and I had to book a new flight myself at significantly higher cost.What followed was an absolute nightmare: The customer service from Booking and Gotogate repeatedly lied, delayed responses, and clearly tried everything to avoid a refund. Their strategy is obvious – stall until the customer gives up. Fair treatment? Absolutely not.Important advice for anyone affected:Don’t trust anything said over the phone – demand written communication. Save all evidence, immediately contact your bank to initiate a chargeback, and get in touch with the public transport arbitration board. Without serious pressure, you won’t get a single cent back. If possible, consider legal action – they won’t pay voluntarily.Conclusion:Booking & Gotogate are unreliable, opaque, and customer-hostile. Stay away! I will never book with them again – and I strongly warn anyone not to make the same mistake.",1,Negative,achtung extrem unseris durch book gotogateich habe ber book einen flug gebucht abgewickelt ber gotogate bezahlt doch die ticket wurden nie ordnungsgem ausgestellt flughafen wurde mir der checkin verweigert stehe uhr nachts flughafen flug verpasst geld weg kundenservice lgt selbststndig neuen flug fr erheblich mehr kosten gebucht danach kam war ein absoluter albtraum der kundenservice von booking und gotogate hat mich belogen hingehalten und mit allen mitteln versucht mich von einer rckerstattung und abzubringen offensichtliche ziel zeit schinden bis der kunde aufgibt ein faire verhalten fehlanzeigewichtiger rat alle betroffenenlasst euch nicht telefon erzhlen besteht auf schriftliche kommunikation sichert alle beweise kontaktiert sofort eure bank fr eine rckbuchung und schaltet die schlichtungsstelle fr den ffentlichen verkehr ein ohne massiven druck bekommt ihr keinen cent zurck wer kann sollte auch rechtliche schritte prfen freiwillig zahlen sie nichtsfazitbooke gotogate sind unzuverlssig intransparent und kundenfeindlich hnde weg ich buche dort nie wieder und kann nur jeden davor warnen den gleichen fehler zu machenenglishi book flight via booking handle gotogate pay full ticket never properly issue stand airport unable check flight miss money go customer service lie book new flight significantly high costwhat follow absolute nightmare customer service booking gotogate repeatedly lie delay response clearly try everything avoid refund strategy obvious stall customer give fair treatment absolutely notimportant advice anyone affecteddont trust anything say phone demand write communication save evidence immediately contact bank initiate chargeback get touch public transport arbitration board without serious pressure will not get single cent back possible consider legal action will not pay voluntarilyconclusionbooke gotogate unreliable opaque customerhostile stay away never book strongly warn anyone make mistake

"I booked a return flight, domestic/International through this company. The Airline changed the timings of my domestic flight and there was not enough lay over for me to take the connecting International flight. I had booked a trip of 8 days including the hotel bookings with this company. I contacted their Agent to sort out the first flight so that I could take the connecting flight. The Agent booked me on an earlier flight and confirmed the booking. This is what it showed on the apps. But when I checked the Airline website, the first leg of the journey no longer existed. The Airline website showed only the Return journey. I contacted Booking.com customer services for cancellation. I was told that I need to contact the Airline to change the status of the ticket and then get back to them.

"The booking of the ticket times out after only 3 minutes and then shows a price 80eur more expensive when it ""refreshes the booking"".

Of course I managed to misspell my name with 1 letter when I finally got through with my payment after my third try. Called their customer support right away and they demanded a fee of 45eur to cancel the ticket and rebook it since it ""didn't go through to the flight company yet so we can cancel it"" and trying to scare me that the ticket can't be changed after it goes through.

"They take advantage of terms and conditions to rip you off. A total scam operation. A 15min flight schedule change resulted in a cancellation of the first leg of a 3 leg trip. I was given the option of a refund from the airline. The first leg of the trip was 4500 (for 5 people), then 500 for the other 2. I had been charged 8700 total including their fees. So a refund of half when 80% was cancelled was absurd. I wasted 10 hours of my life being bounced from agent to agent with each conversation starting afresh.  Two weeks and 15 hours of my life lost. I’m now using a chargeback to get my money back.  As you can see from their reply they are misleading. They offer a refund of airline charges for the first leg only.

"Gotogate is by far the worst travel agency I have ever dealt with. Their customer service is nonexistent, and their handling of flight changes or modifications is absolutely incompetent and frustrating.I have been trying to modify my booking for over a month, and despite countless calls and emails, I have received zero helpful responses. Both airlines involved have clearly stated that Gotogate is responsible for making the changes, yet Gotogate refuses to take any action. Instead, they keep passing me around with generic, unhelpful replies while my travel plans remain in limbo.Their so-called ""customer support"" is a complete joke. They ignore requests, provide misleading information, and take no responsibility for resolving issues. They are quick to take your money but absolutely useless when you actually need assistance.If you value your time, money, and sanity, DO NOT book through Gotogate.

I was told on several occasions that the refund was being processed. However, yesterday on the phone I was told that the flight was not actually cancelled but had a changed time for the return leg and I would not get a refund. Apparently they knew this on 15th March but were still insisting that a refund was being processed. I have not been able to speak to anyone in the company today.

"I booked a ticket through GoToGate and encountered travel issues, so I reached out to their customer service for guidance on the refund policy. The agent assured me I could cancel the ticket with a partial refund after fees. Based on this, I proceeded — only to later be told by another agent that my ticket was completely non-refundable.When I explained that their own agent misinformed me, they apologized, called it a mistake, and refused to take responsibility or offer any compensation. It’s frustrating that I’m expected to bear the cost of their error.Calls are recorded, so they could easily verify the conversation — yet they showed no effort to investigate or make things right.

"DO NOT USE! REMEMBER THAT THEY CAN AND WILL TAKE ALL OF YOUR MONEY IF THEY CAN. It is NOT WORTH the 25USD you save by buying on their website.Here's my experience. I booked flights from BOM to HKG return (total cost 7149HKD, plus premium support package 385HKD which waives any additional fees of mytrip.com). The airline cancellation fee per ticket was 549HKD.However, my visa or pre-arrival registration to Hong Kong got rejected. So I reached out to mytrip.com to cancel my tickets but also requested them to try and waive the 549HKD cancellation fee charged by Cathay because Cathay mentioned they offer full refund due to visa cancellation. mytrip.com's customer service in processing this was very inadequate and slow but they did do it and sent me a link (which weirdly said ""medical certificate"" proof) to send documents proof - which I did.A few weeks went by and nothing - they didnt even return the fare MINUS THE CANCELLATION FEE which I asked them to a few times and got completely useless customer support. Suddenly one day I find a status on their website on my order saying ""Refund received from Cathay and sent to credit card"". But i didnt see this on my credit card at all so I reached out to them after giving a week or so to see if it might reflect late. And they said ""Oh your documents were not valid so we can't refund you"". I'm like - What do u mean by ""you can't refund me"".Even if the documents are ""not valid"" (not sure why, coz I sent whatever I had - ""pre-arrival registration unsuccessful"" screenshot), I should at least and first get back the fare minus the cancellation fee. They claimed ""Oh u asked for refund by special condition so no refund for you"". By this time,I had wasted hours of my life on this, and didnt see the point of wasting hours more on this.There you go. I was never told at any point that there was any special condition. All I asked was waiver of cancellation fee and instead they took the entire fare on a flimsy pretence. So much for ""premium support"".Lesson learnt - No free lunch. If they're charging 25 USD less, it's because they reckon they have a chance at making away with 1000USD from you. Which is what they did.PS - They're fairly diabolical too. There's a small byline in their terms and conditions which says ""Certain tickets are non-refundable"". They use that to justify to American Express if you try to dispute their transaction even though clearly my ticket was a refundable one with a clear cancellation fee.Company operates in different names so the bad reviews are spread out. Gotogate-mytrip.com etc etc. Even though my experience was with my trip.com, at the backend the credit card company etc had gotogate.

"I had an incredibly frustrating experience with this agency and will never use it again. It feels like I’ve been scammed.  I booked a round-trip flight through this agency involving two different airlines and opted for baggage service (my mistake for not verifying the airlines' baggage charges in advance on their website).  The first airline was fine, even though the baggage fee was £1 higher than booking directly with the airline—still tolerable. However, for the return flight, I later discovered (while updating my documents on the airline’s website) that the ticket already included a 10kg baggage allowance. This meant I unnecessarily paid an additional baggage fee of £74 (37*2).  When I contacted customer service to request a refund for this excess charge, they refused, claiming that the amount was applied as a “total markup fee” (whatever that means) and was non-refundable. Instead, they simply apologised for the inconvenience. What good are your apologies? I want my money back.  If the airline isn’t charging for baggage, why did you?  You might argue that I voluntarily selected the baggage option, but isn’t it your responsibility to align with the airline’s baggage services when offering these options? I chose your platform as an intermediary, expecting transparency and accuracy—yet this is how you operate?  I paid you specifically to facilitate the necessary requests to the airline on my behalf. Since the airline provides a complimentary 10kg baggage allowance, shouldn’t you refund that amount instead of keeping it and dismissing my claim under some vague “markup fee” excuse? I paid for baggage, and even the receipt you provided clearly lists baggage under the charges.  Had there been an extra fee at the time of booking, you wouldn’t have hesitated to charge me. So why is it any different when I’ve overpaid?  This is highly unethical and unprofessional. Stop imposing charges that don’t belong to you.  To make matters worse, even after paying the baggage fee, the airline’s system does not guarantee my baggage as cabin luggage. The airline’s website has an option to confirm cabin baggage, which costs only £6 per bag (still optional), yet your platform charged significantly more. When I asked your representative how long it would take for my baggage status to update, they said there was no specific timeframe. How irresponsible!  You are leaving me no choice but to express my distress on social platforms, escalate this issue with consumer rights authorities, and pursue legal action if necessary.",1,Negative,incredibly frustrating experience agency never use feel like I ve scamme book roundtrip flight agency involve two different airline opt baggage service mistake verifying airline baggage charge advance website first airline fine even though baggage fee high booking directly airlinestill tolerable however return flight later discover update document airline website ticket already include kg baggage allowance meant unnecessarily pay additional baggage fee contact customer service request refund excess charge refuse claim amount apply total markup fee whatever mean nonrefundable instead simply apologise inconvenience good apology want money back airline be not charge baggage might argue voluntarily select baggage option be not responsibility align airline baggage service offer option choose platform intermediary expect transparency accuracyyet operate pay specifically facilitate necessary request airline behalf since airline provide complimentary kg baggage allowance should not refund amount instead keep dismiss claim vague markup fee excuse pay baggage even receipt provide clearly list baggage charge extra fee time booking would not hesitate charge different I ve overpay highly unethical unprofessional stop impose charge do not belong make matter bad even pay baggage fee airline system guarantee baggage cabin luggage airline website option confirm cabin baggage cost per bag still optional yet platform charge significantly ask representative long would take baggage status update say specific timeframe irresponsible leave choice express distress social platform escalate issue consumer right authority pursue legal action necessary

"Extremely Poor Service – Never Booking with Gotogate AgainI had one of the worst customer service experiences with Gotogate. On March 4, 2025, I received an email stating that my flight was cancelled, and I was invited to request a refund. I did so immediately and received confirmation that my request was being processed.Two weeks later, I suddenly received another email claiming that the flight was not cancelled, only rescheduled. This contradicts their earlier communication and caused serious confusion and financial loss, as I had already booked a new ticket based on the cancellation notice.I contacted Gotogate via chat multiple times. The support agents were either unwilling or unable to assist me. Several tried to dismiss my concerns, and the chat connection was repeatedly cut off during conversations. I had to explain the situation from the beginning over and over again.Even after a long discussion, they promised the refund would go through, but I still have no confirmation. They blame the airline (Arkia), but as a customer, my contract is with Gotogate.This company shows no responsibility, poor communication, and a complete lack of accountability. I strongly advise others to avoid Gotogate at all costs. I will never book through them again.Update:Gotogate has replied here, but their response was vague and not addressing the actual issue.They keep referring to a schedule change, while I have an official email from them dated March 4 stating that the flight was cancelled.I followed their instructions, requested a refund, and was told it was being processed. Weeks later, still no result, no timeline, and no clear communication — just generic messages like “we’re working on it.”Even in their public response, they used a strange reference to “lodging needs” — showing once again that my case isn’t being handled seriously.I’m still waiting for a proper resolution.

"This company is a scam. Avoid them at all costs!I booked a flight via Booking.com with GoToGate for 30th March, and the payment was successfully deducted from my account. I received a confirmation code and PIN. However, when I checked later, my booking had mysteriously changed to 30th April, and a second unauthorised payment had been taken from my account!At first, I thought I had made a mistake, so I contacted customer service on 16th March. They told me I could change the booking by paying £9.21, which I agreed to. Ten minutes later, I received an email saying, “Sorry, we converted the incorrect currency. The actual fee is £45.06.” Even though I had confirmed the price with the agent three times, they refused to honour their mistake.This wasn’t the only issue, I had also booked a hotel a day before, and they took two different payments but only confirmed one booking. I had to reclaim the money via my bank. At this point, I started to realise this was not my mistake, it was GoToGate’s system. Luckily, I had screenshots proving my original flight booking was for 30th March, not April!I called again on 17th March, asking to escalate my complaint. I was told a manager would call me back within 3 hours. No one called.I followed up three days later and was told a supervisor would call back. Again, no call.By 23rd March, I had been waiting a full week. I called again and was told supervisors must respond within 24 hours. When I asked why I hadn’t received a callback in seven days, they said:“We don’t have a reason, I’m sorry. You just have to wait.”Then, the agent cut my call off saying:“I cannot offer you a solution, so I have to cut the phone off.”This is the most disgusting customer service I have ever experienced. They ignored my evidence, took my money without authorisation, refused to follow their own complaints procedure, and when I demanded answers, they cut me off.At every stage, they have shown a complete lack of accountability and only offer empty apologies instead of actual solutions. Instead of fixing their mistake, they expect me to pay more!DO NOT BOOK WITH GOTOGATE! If I do not get a resolution, I will escalate this to consumer protection agencies, my bank, and legal action.

"Beware!!! This agent will try to impose unnecessary charges. The airline cancelled our original direct flight and rebooked us on an flight 5 days after our original return date. We contacted the agent for alternatives who said that they would need to ask the airline for authorisation. After days of waiting, no response, so we contacted the airline. The airline informed us that we were allowed one free change, but as we booked through an agent, we would need to ask the agent to make this change. A response from the agent was finally received a day after our original return date to inform us that the change was not possible. Read the other bad reviews, they are all true. As a previous customer of this agent my hopes were initially high, but after this experience I have learned the hard way to expect no customer service if anything goes wrong. Update: 24/3/25: I was expecting a reply to that effect, clearly it is your standard reply against any negative feedback. You do have the booking code and so fully aware of what truly happened. My only intention of my review was to warn others of your company and obviously expect any compensation from Gotogate.

"I was looking for a ticket that is not too specific in terms of destination or price, but my most important point was the luggage, and more specifically the extra luggage because I needed to carry a lot of stuff.The ticket I found on Gotogate had an option to add an extra luggage for 12000 JPY, which I thought was a great deal, so I took the ticket and all went smoothly.A day later, I receive an email from someone in Gotogate telling me that the extra luggage was cancelled due to a ""technical error"" and that the amount was refunded and will be sent to my account within a few days, and throwing me at the air carrier asking me to reach out to them to get the extra luggage.Now that's neither professional nor fair the customer.If you have a technical error on your website, then it's your duty to coordinate between the customer and air carrier... additionally the price that was included in the booking (which is a kind of a contract) should be negotiated and only after the customer approves, the move to either cancel it or copay it or other options should be taken.Gotogate just dumped the shit on my head and asked me to accept their apologies and that they were sorry for the inconvenience....I call that a big pile of horse shite!I am stuck with a ticket that I am not finding interesting cuz I don't want to pay a hefty price for the extra luggage, if I knew that there will be a technical problem, I would have chosen another carrier or found alternatives... what am I gonna do with my extra luggage now! Inconvenience is a huge understatement Gotogate!!!Edit: (Reply to GotoGate answer to my comment):If you say so, then why keep the luggage allowance option on your system? We are in 2025 and having a synchronous update from/with the air carrier is an easy thing... why keep the option to add extra luggage there on your booking page if it doesn't work!It's unprofessional and completely misleading people and causing pain and frustration and additional burden and stress!!

"I have high praise for Ms Yousrinah Toorabally who handled my air ticket cancellation due to a double booking  (under spouse name vs maiden name).  Yousrinah was very polite, efficient and provided me with accurate information (concerning the exact amount of penalty and the estimated refund processing time etc) for me to make a decision.  Thanks to Yousrinah I've obtained the refund and the airline refunded all the taxes as well.  Gotogate sent me an email asking me to evaluate the performance of Yousrinah right after our telephone conversation and her email summarising the case.  I had decided to answer the evaluation email after having received my refund,  but the link has already expired.

"On 12 Jan 2025:  I purchased flights via Booking.com to the value of nearly AUD $2KCustomer reference/ Order number: [redacted]17 Jan 2025:  received an SMS to say that the 2 flights Melbourne (MEL) to Chiang Mai (CNX) had been cancelled. We did not receive an email about the cancellation and the Booking.com web page still shows the incorrect flight details as at 21 March 2025!An alternative was offered in the SMS that did not suit our needs. We never would have booked the flights if the one offered is the one that was presented on the booking site. I contacted Booking.com via the chat to discuss other options. Bookings.com use a third party called GotoGate, all chats and phone calls have been with GotoGate. Note GotoGate is owned by Etraveli Group.GotoGate could not offer any realistic alternatives and they said I could request a refund. 21 Jan 2025:  I requested a refund via the chat. I was informed by GotoGate that they will contact the airline and I would be refunded within 10-15 days. I was informed the amount of this portion of the flight was [redacted] that would be refunded. Since this date up until today 21 March 2025: I have contacted GotoGate numerous times via the chat function (and always requested a copy of the transcript, which may or may not be emailed to you once the chat ends) and also one phone call (which I recorded). In summary they repeat the script that they have requested the refund from the airline and that they are waiting on the airline and they have ‘escalated’ the matter. They cannot offer an explanation of what éscalate’ means or explain how they are following up. I have spent hours on the phone and chat function trying to follow this up and secure the refund for the flights they cancelled.GotoGate also advises us to check their booking site:  to see the refund status under ""My Booking"" tab with order number and registered email id. The Order number provided by GotoGate is [redacted] which displays as invalid on their own booking website. The GotoGate person on the phone then said to try this Order number [redacted] which also displays as invalid on their own site. The person on the phone could not explain why it was invalid just said to use those numbers!It was also suggested by GototGate that we follow up directly with Air Asia. So I did. Air Asia requires a booking number or PNR which consists of 6 characters. Gotogate does not provide this information to the customer. AirAsia also say if  you booked thru an agent you need to go thru the agent which is Booking.com.Now, after now reading reviews on the web I have no confidence in Booking.com/ Gotogate/ Etraveli Group ability to deliver any of the flights. I believe Booking.com selling flights (flights that never existed) is a scam as we are still waiting on a refund and have had no communication. Note also the positive reviews on this site are mainly 'invited'.27/3/2025: still waiting for a refund and the same lies and stalling occurring in the chat with conflicting messages.

"I booked a flight from Lisbon to London via GTG. I paid extra for checked baggage.Within hours, GTG cancelled our baggage. We did get a refund for the baggage, HOWEVER without baggage, the flight was useless to us.I contacted GTG to see about getting the checked baggage back. They said i could get a refund (less $66pp) or i could contact the airline to arrange baggage or do it at the airport (we all know that last option is super expensive).I said I'd contact the airline. The airline didn't respond to any of my emails.Went back to GTG to get the refund but was told that we were outside the ""cancellation period - that was not mentioned in the first contact!I don't feel that the ""cancellation period"" should apply as the problem was caused by GTG and they will not refund any of our ticket costs. They are hiding behind their T&C's but I feel that the moral obligation rests with GTG to do the right thing and refund us our money.To reiterate: if we'd known the flight didn't allow for baggage, we'd not have booked that flight and GTG is NOT meeting their MORAL obligations!I'll not use GTG again, nor any other 3rd party booking agents.",1,Negative,book flight lisbon london via gtg pay extra check baggagewithin hour gtg cancel baggage get refund baggage however without baggage flight useless usi contact gtg see getting check baggage back say could get refund less pp could contact airline arrange baggage airport know last option super expensivei say i d contact airline airline do not respond emailswent back gtg get refund tell outside cancellation period mention first contacti do not feel cancellation period apply problem cause gtg refund ticket cost hide behind tcs feel moral obligation rest gtg right thing refund we moneyto reiterate we d know flight do not allow baggage we d book flight gtg meeting moral obligationsill use gtg rd party booking agent

"I was on vacation in Canada when my father died suddenly and unexpectedly. Because of this I needed to immediately fly back to my home country to my family and arrange my father’s funeral.My father needed to get an autopsy to know the cause of death and that’s why the funeral happened 4 days later.I had 2 flights booked via GotoGate and as soon as I knew I canceled both flights.Order number: 1008-588-665Order number: 1017-880-769The flights were canceled and the costumer service sent me a link to submit a form to ask for a refund for both flights, and I submitted both forms online on the same day. At this time I didn’t have the official international death certificate document of my father yet because I only got this document later because of the autopsy.I had to request the document and it took some time. I submitted the other documents requested online through the given link because I knew I only had 5 days to do this after I received the link to submit the official international death certificate document of my father.

On the same day I sent the official international death certificate document of my father back to Kalomoira K as a response to her e-mail (I have screen shots of the e-mails).On the 9th of September, Olga S second line support Etraveli group sent me an e-mail where she writes that she was unable to process my request with the information provided, and asked me to resubmit the request with a copy of the official international death certificate document of my father, and I answered back to her that I didn’t have another document and that what I attached on my e-mail on the 4th of September to Kalomoira K was already the only official paid signed and stamped international death certificate document of my father in English and other languages and that there is no other document.I booked 2 flights via Gotogate with the same airline company (WestJet), and got refund for one flight but not the other one.

"Had paid for baggage on flight with GoToGat but they did not pass on booking to the airline.  We therefore had to pay again at the airport to get our bags on the plane.  Since then I have requested a refund but their customer service is shocking!  They keep requesting the same information over again and do nothing with it. Definitely a company to avoid!Interestingly, gotogate have responded to this review.  They however, continue not to respond to any other attempt to contact them.  I have now been promised twice that they will get back to me within 24h to resolve the issue; still waiting!This doesn't just feel like poor customer service.

I have rang this company for 10 times after that same answer. On the 16th of March, they said you have to pay extra money for the airline charge, and within 24 hours, this will be sorted. I waited and waited.When I rang they said we have contacted the airline I spoke to airline direct; they said there is no request for a name change.I wanted my money, and they said they have to charge half of the ticket.

"I had a terrible experience with Gotogate, and I strongly advise against booking through them.I purchased round-trip tickets through their platform. Due to unforeseen circumstances, I had to confirm the status of my return ticket. At first, their customer support told me it was canceled. After long negotiations, they assured me that my ticket was still valid and even sent an official confirmation via email.However, when I arrived at the airport for my return flight, I was denied boarding because the ticket had actually been canceled. When I contacted Gotogate for urgent help, they completely backtracked on their previous confirmation. Instead of taking responsibility, they kept stalling and eventually stopped providing real responses—just generic automated messages from a chatbot. No solution, no accountability, just wasted time and additional expenses.As a result, I had to spend an extra €1,500 on new tickets and accommodation while waiting for a resolution that never came.Their incompetence and misleading communication caused me significant financial losses and a great deal of stress. They also refused to provide full company details, making it impossible to escalate the issue properly.I highly recommend avoiding Gotogate if you value your time, money, and peace of mind.My reservation # 1047-089-365MBQ0GS",1,Negative,terrible experience gotogate strongly advise book themi purchase roundtrip ticket platform due unforeseen circumstance confirm status return ticket first customer support tell cancel long negotiation assure ticket still valid even send official confirmation via emailhowever arrive airport return flight deny boarding ticket actually cancel contact gotogate urgent help completely backtrack previous confirmation instead take responsibility keep stall eventually stop provide real responsesjust generic automate message chatbot solution accountability waste time additional expensesas result spend extra new ticket accommodation wait resolution never cametheir incompetence mislead communication cause significant financial loss great deal stress also refuse provide full company detail make impossible escalate issue properlyi highly recommend avoid gotogate value time money peace mindmy reservation mbqgs

"The company is betting on all flights taking place so they don't have to do any extra work. As soon as your flight is cancelled by an airline - you are screwed, because the ONLY option they are going to offer you is refund. While under EU law the airline must offer the choice of rebook or refund, and the airlines do offer that, gotogate doesn't want to bother with rebooking you so they say ""no options for rebook, we can only refund"". Needless to add refund doesn't cover the cost of the new tickets. This is an unlawful practice to hide the choice from the customers who maybe don't know that they are legally entitled to have an option of rebooking, and I am surely reporting that to regulatory institutions and involving my legal insurance in the process of getting my new tickets booked as they should be. Update to respond to the reply:Changes are absolutely fine, but the airline ALWAYS offers a possibility of rebook. I also contacted KLM and they confirmed rebook is possible and its free, also for the agency doing it on my behalf. But gotogate refuses to offer this option, insisting on the refund, which I refuse.",1,Negative,company bet flight take place do not extra work soon flight cancel airline screw option go offer refund eu law airline must offer choice rebook refund airline offer gotogate do not want bother rebooke say option rebook refund needless add refund do not cover cost new ticket unlawful practice hide choice customer maybe do not know legally entitle option rebooke surely report regulatory institution involve legal insurance process get new ticket book update respond replychange absolutely fine airline always offer possibility rebook also contact klm confirm rebook possible free also agency behalf gotogate refuse offer option insist refund refuse

"I purchased business class flights for my wife and myself via Booking.com on the 27/1/2025. We received the following message on the 28/1/2025 from Gotogate ""Due to a technical error, we were unable to complete the purchase of seat for order number XXXX. Please note that your flight tickets are not affected by this error. To complete your request, please book your ancillary product on the airline’s website. We apologize for the inconvenience.""The contact number provided by Booking.com is answered by Gotogate's call centre. On the 28/1/2025 I spoke to Krishan K who verbally confirmed we had business class seats on all legs of the itinerary. I pointed out that it was the ticketing agents legal responsibility to sort this issue out. He emailed with the following request, ""As per telephonic conversation, kindly share confirmation regarding flight and contact us so that we can escalate the concern."" I replied to this email on the 28/01/2025 providing the requested information, specifically that we had been booked in economy for the final leg.I again spoke with a Gotogate representative on 11/3/202. I shared that I hadn't had a response to my email and that on checking the airlines website, the booking class for the final leg of our itinerary hadn't changed. Sayed M shared that he couldn't see that I had previously contacted Gotogate and was unable to search the reference number provided in the email I had received from Gotogate following my initial telephone call. Sayed M verbally and via email confirmed all legs of the itinerary were booked in business class but that he was unable to confirm the requested seats in business class on the last leg of our itinerary. I requested that this issue be resolved within the next 48 hrs given the length of time since my original contact on the 28/1/2025.As of 20/3/2025 I haven't had a response from Gotogate and on checking the airlines website, the last leg remains booked in economy. When I spoke to the airlines customer service representative, not surprisingly he wasn't able to assist and referred me back to Gotogate. The airline representative shared that there had been a change to the departure time for the first leg of the itinerary which we hadn't been notified of by Gotogate.I rang Gotogate directly (+1 786 405 851) and waited 40 minutes despite the recording continually saying I was first in line and my call would be answered in 30 sec. I spoke to Jia P and she initially stated all seats for all legs of our itinerary were ticketed in business class. I shared that the last leg wasn't and that this was confirmed on both the airlines website and by the airlines representative to whom I spoke. Jia P then stated that the error in ticketing had arisen due to a schedule change. I strongly refuted this claim, pointing out that I had flagged this issue on the 28/1/2025, long before any ""schedule change"". Jia P then shared that she could see on the airlines website that we were booked in economy on the final leg of our itinerary and that she would escalate my complaint and that I would receive a response within 48 hrs. She also sent an email stating, ""As we have already verified, we have already escalated this issue to our dedicated team and they will work on your request. I ask you to wait while our team contact the airline and checks this and gets back to you as soon as possible"".I don't anticipate getting resolution from Gotogate to this issue within the next 48hrs given the lack of response to date! UPDATE 21/3/2025As noted below, Gotogate responded on this website and approximately 5 minutes later I received an email from a Gotogate representative, Nitesh M stating ""he had tried calling me but was unable to connect"". I had no missed calls and no voice messages were left!  Gotogate's response was from an email address that didn't allow me to reply directly to Nitesh M! The instructions were to contact them either by phone or chat.  The chat function had not worked all day and still wasn't working when I tried following receiving Nitesh M's email.  I finally was able to speak to Jasmine M approximately 30 minutes after receiving Nitesh M's email. Her response was that she was unable to assist, ""We are sorry to inform you that we are now facing a system issue due to which we could not complete your request. Please contact us after couple of hours to investigate and help you with your request."" Jasmine M recommended I send my complaint to privacy.etraveligroup.com.

"they are the executing partner for booking.com flights. I recently had a deeply unsatisfactory experience trying to change flight dates through Booking.com. I reached out to customer support five separate times—three by phone and twice via chat—to adjust my original flight booking to new dates.Initially, Booking.com quoted drastically inconsistent fees for the change:First chat: €940 total (unreasonable and more expensive than simply booking new flights).Email follow-up: even higher fees (€564 for TAP Portugal, €189 for EasyJet, totaling €753).Later phone call: suddenly reduced to €470, which I ultimately paid, despite official airline websites clearly showing the fees should total around €300.Throughout the process, Booking.com's customer service was unprofessional and confusing:Representatives continuously provided different fee amounts without clear explanations.Requests to speak to a manager were repeatedly ignored.Representatives refused to provide a detailed breakdown of charges when asked, claiming they had already given all necessary information.Directions on how to file an official complaint were vague and unhelpful.After finally paying, the confusion continued. My reference number was not recognized, requiring yet another lengthy call with customer service. Even after this call, I discovered that only the departing flight had been changed—not the return flight. Upon contacting support again, I was told it would take several more hours to confirm this remaining change, further adding to the frustration and lack of transparency.Overall, this experience was extremely disappointing, unprofessional, and unnecessarily costly. I strongly discourage booking flights through Booking.com, as their handling of changes and customer support is unreliable and misleading.Edit: they mentioned that I ""failed to add a reference code in the private part of this review"".

"ABSOLUTELY SCAMMERS! Do not recommend and please, do not buy with them for the following reasons:- They charge 130% more on luggage.- They have a fee for ANYTHING you might need. Ex. The airline cancelled my flight and offered an alternative for free, but because I bought with them, they charged me to make the change. - Customer service gives mixed information - first call, the attendant said that no fee was to be charged if the airline cancelled the flight; talking to another attendant, he said that a fee had to be charged, then a third, that confirmed that the last was incorrect...

"I recently booked a flight through Gotogate and needed to make a change to my booking. Unfortunately, the process with Gotogate was frustrating and unhelpful. Their customer service was difficult to reach, and when I finally got through, they were unable to assist me effectively.In the end, I had to contact the airline directly, and they were able to resolve my issue quickly.

"I booked a flight through Gotogate, and the airline changed my itinerary to an inconvenient flight with a stopover. I requested a rebooking on March 2, and despite multiple follow-ups, they kept stalling with the same excuse: ""waiting for confirmation."" The airline confirmed to me that Gotogate has full authority to change my ticket, yet Gotogate refuses to act.After more than two weeks of delays, empty promises, and no clear timelines, I am still waiting for my flight to be rebooked. Every time I contact them, they ask me for the same details again as if my request never existed.

"They are totally irresponsible with the order they made for me. Truly, they seem to just care about me buying flight tickets from them, and that they don't bother helping with any further matter. First, the airline (Malaysia Airlines/MAS, but the flight is managed by Air Canada) cancelled my outgoing trip and as a result they (gotogate) proposed an alternative trip more than 24 hours after the cancelled trip, despite being able to offer an alternative flight on the same day from their website. Of course they proposed to cancel the whole flight (outbound & return), but it was less than 2 weeks before the trip, everything is just too expensive to buy a new one. When I requested gotogate to only refund that part of the trip, gotogate wasn't able to get the airline to change the system, stating that it was all booked under one booking code (I don't know what they mean).Then I also requested to be moved to the nearest available flight from that airline, gotogate wasn't able to do it either citing that they have not received any reply from the airline. I tried calling the airline, they were able to change it, but citing that since I am not their customer, I should get gotogate to request the change first. The airline agent told me that I am not recommended to skip one part of the flight because that can invalidate the whole booking. This means that I have no choice to accept the alternative flight.After multiple calls and messages with gotogate, I am less than 48 hours before the trip, by which, they happily send me an email telling me that I am now allowed to contact the airline by myself and the get the change. I did call Air Canada, and it was done in less than 10 minutes.Good, now what I didn't realise is that the system is so screwed up, they managed to leave my booking on a wrong state in the system that when I tried to check in for return flight. I was told that the airline (Jetstar Airways, managed the first leg of the return trip) couldn't check me in, despite my name being in the system. I called AirCanada, and they claimed that it is goto gate, and when I called gotogate, they claimed that it is not their fault.As a result, I was forced to buy a expensive one-way ticket on the spot, in order to be able to take the next leg of the flight from Singapore. Nobody wants to take the blame. It is really a horrible experience with gotogate, there's no sympathy from them. I told them that they are selling me a ticket that cannot be used, and they told me that it is not their fault. Well, if you feel responsible as a merchant, then you should at least try to help me refund the part of the flight that I wasn't able to take just because someone that you contracted with couldn't get the system right.Truly horrible, I would leave gotogate MINUS 5 stars if I can. I don't recommend this agent even though you think you can get a good deal. If it is too cheap, then it's possible that they will rearrange your flight closer to the date, and you have no choice to accept a horrible alternative or ""just cancel your flight"" (mind you, it's 2 weeks before the departure).Terrible experience.Good luck with this agent.",1,Negative,totally irresponsible order make truly seem care buying flight ticket do not bother help matter first airline malaysia airlinesmas flight manage air canada cancel outgoing trip result gotogate propose alternative trip hour cancel trip despite able offer alternative flight day website course propose cancel whole flight outbound return less week trip everything expensive buy new one request gotogate refund part trip gotogate be not able get airline change system state book one booking code do not know meanthen also request move near available flight airline gotogate be not able either cite receive reply airline try call airline able change cite since customer get gotogate request change first airline agent tell recommend skip one part flight invalidate whole booking mean choice accept alternative flightafter multiple call message gotogate less hour trip happily send email telling allow contact airline get change call air canada do less minutesgood do not realise system screw manage leave book wrong state system try check return flight tell airline jetstar airways manage first leg return trip could not check despite name system call aircanada claim goto gate call gotogate claim faulta result force buy expensive oneway ticket spot order able take next leg flight singapore nobody want take blame really horrible experience gotogate there s sympathy tell sell ticket use tell fault well feel responsible merchant least try help refund part flight be not able take someone contract could not get system righttruly horrible would leave gotogate minus star do not recommend agent even though think get good deal cheap possible rearrange flight close date choice accept horrible alternative cancel flight mind week departureterrible experiencegood luck agent

"In „answering“ my report on Get to gate (see below) I received  the following „response“:Get to Gate:„ Hi ,As you have failed to provide us with a valid booking code in the private section of the review, we are unable to locate your booking in our system and see what truly happened.Best regards,Mytrip team""This is yet another indication of this company´s character:Adding taunt to demage, they accuse me of „having failed“  to provide them  with personal details.Maybe the trick to change booking details when clicking on „book“ ist legal but it surely is illegitimate. I am not that stupid to provide  such a questionable company with my private details!They deride me with the   allusion, „asking“,  „what truly happend“! What „truly happend“ I have precisely discribed in my review. The procedure was confirmed by gettogate and the faulty booking dismissed: with „bad luck for you“!It´s very telling that  this company  insinuates, that others do not tell „what truly happened“:  it´s very common, to draw conclusions from oneself to others!I would have written this directly to Gettogeate, but  it is not possible to track down Gettogate to a valid postal or at least Email address!     They might have good reasons to hide.As the faulty booking concernes a very reputable airline I shall communicate with them about this conduct.      Adding those indications to the already reported, I can only repeat my strong advice to look out like hell when dealing with GTT!

"I booked a flight from Manila to El Nido with Gotogate for November 17th, 2024 (Booking number: 1023-250-074), but it was canceled due to a typhoon by the airline. Since then, I have been fighting to get my refund, but it has been a complete nightmare.I have contacted Gotogate four times to resolve the issue. The first two times, customer service promised to look into the problem because they couldn’t see the cancellation in their system. Instead of investigating properly, I received misleading emails claiming that I requested to cancel the booking myself (December 7th, 2024) or stating that there were no schedule changes associated with my booking (January 21st, 2025). This is completely false — the flight was canceled by the airline on the day of travel!In February, I finally managed to get a response from the airline (AirSwift), confirming that they had already refunded the amount to Gotogate on February 1st, 2025, and that Gotogate was responsible for returning the money to me. I also found a Gotogate customer service email and contacted them directly on February 13th, 2025 — no response to this day.One month later, I called Gotogate again and was finally transferred to a department that seemed to understand the problem. They promised to investigate and coordinate with the airline. Yet today (March 15th, 2025), I received an email claiming that they couldn’t access my booking on some “website” and that I should contact the airline myself. What kind of nonsense is this? Why would they be browsing the airline’s website looking for a cancellation from four months ago instead of directly contacting their business partner?If Gotogate insists on searching websites instead of calling the airline, they can easily find the cancellation notice on AirSwift’s official Facebook page. The post from November 16th, 2024, clearly lists the canceled flights due to the typhoon — including mine!Gotogate is clearly deliberately making the process as difficult as possible, hoping that customers will give up on their refund claims. This is beyond frustrating and absolutely unacceptable. I am not giving up — I will pursue legal action if necessary.

However, just a few weeks before my trip, I was informed that the second leg of my return flight had been cancelled.Instead of offering me an alternative flight, Booking.com redirected me to the associated platform, Gotogate, who simply told me my only option was to cancel and get a refund. This is completely unacceptable, especially since rebooking now would cost me nearly £2,000, far more than my original ticket.What’s worse? I did my own research and found multiple alternative routes on Booking.com (via Gotogate) with the same airline that could get me home. But they made no effort to rebook me. They just want to wash their hands of the issue.A trustworthy travel agent should help customers find solutions, not just push them toward a refund that leaves them stranded with no reasonable replacement. If you’re considering booking through Gotogate via Booking.com, think twice. Because if something goes wrong, you’ll be on your own.---My answer to their reply (below):Thank you for your response, but it misses the point entirely.The issue isn’t just that the airline made changes. It’s the fact that your service offered zero helpful solutions. When I contacted the airline directly, they were able to accommodate me on an alternative flight—something Gotogate didn’t even suggest or assist with.This begs the question: What exactly is the purpose of booking through an agency like Gotogate if, when something goes wrong, I’m left to sort it out on my own? Your role should be to advocate for and assist your customers, not simply pass on bad news and leave them stranded.This experience has made it very clear to me (and anyone reading this) that booking through Gotogate adds unnecessary complication without any real support when things go wrong. Extremely disappointing.",1,Negative,month ago book flight london japan gotogate via bookingcom deal seem great time trust platform handle longhaul booking however week trip inform second leg return flight cancelledinstead offer alternative flight bookingcom redirect associate platform gotogate simply tell option cancel get refund completely unacceptable especially since rebooking would cost nearly far original ticketwhat bad research find multiple alternative route bookingcom via gotogate airline could get home make effort rebook want wash hand issuea trustworthy travel agent help customer find solution push toward refund leave strand reasonable replacement you re consider book gotogate via bookingcom think twice something go wrong you ll ownmy answer reply belowthank response miss point entirelythe issue be not airline make change fact service offer zero helpful solution contact airline directly able accommodate alternative flightsomethe gotogate do not even suggest assist withthis beg question exactly purpose book agency like gotogate something go wrong I m leave sort role advocate assist customer simply pass bad news leave strandedthis experience make clear anyone read book gotogate add unnecessary complication without real support thing go wrong extremely disappointing
"I had the worst experience with Gotogate, and I strongly advise against using their services. Their customer support is dishonest, unhelpful, and rude. I needed to rebook my travel dates, and their agent Tanvi P. outright lied, claiming that the airline does not allow changes. To verify, I contacted the airline directly, and they confirmed that changes were possible, proving that Gotogate was simply making excuses to avoid assisting me.Things got worse when I spoke to Tanvi P., who was not only unhelpful but also extremely rude. When I asked for an escalation, she boldly claimed there is no escalation matrix and that she is the ""owner of Gotogate""—the final point of contact. This level of arrogance and lack of professionalism is absolutely unacceptable for a company handling travel bookings.Gotogate’s customer service is non-existent—they take your money and abandon you when you need support. Instead of helping, they mislead customers, refuse responsibility, and provide false information. Their only goal is to extract money with no regard for customer experience.Do yourself a favor and avoid Gotogate at all costs. Book directly with the airline or through a reputable travel agency that actually values its customers.",1,Negative,bad experience gotogate strongly advise use service customer support dishonest unhelpful rude need rebook travel date agent tanvi p outright lie claim airline allow change verify contact airline directly confirm change possible prove gotogate simply make excuse avoid assist mething get bad speak tanvi p unhelpful also extremely rude ask escalation boldly claim escalation matrix owner gotogatethe final point contact level arrogance lack professionalism absolutely unacceptable company handle travel bookingsgotogate customer service nonexistentthey take money abandon need support instead help mislead customer refuse responsibility provide false information goal extract money regard customer experiencedo favor avoid gotogate cost book directly airline reputable travel agency actually value customer

"I am extremely disappointed with Gotogate. After canceling my flight, I was repeatedly told that the refund was still pending from the airline. This was a lie.After directly contacting the Airlines, I discovered that Gotogate never even submitted a refund request. Instead of taking action, they kept stalling me with false information. This behavior is unacceptable and highly unprofessional. Anyone booking with Gotogate should be aware that in case of any issues, they provide no real support—just excuses and delays. I will never book with Gotogate again and strongly advise others to stay away!Update 18.03.2025Gotogate continues to lie – Booking number was correctly provided!Gotogate falsely claims that I did not provide a valid booking number. This is yet another lie! The booking number was correctly submitted and is visible in my Gotogate account. In fact, the portal even states that the refund request was sent to the airline – which is provably false, as the airline confirmed to me directly that no such request was ever made.This deliberate deception further proves that Gotogate is not just highly unprofessional but systematically misleading customers.

I have contacted booking/ go to gate many times and they said they had already asked from the refund, but there has been more than a month since the flight got cancelled and I haven't received my money back. Not to mention that I had to pay much more for a new ticket. The last information I got from Euroairlines was that the agency should request the refund through BSP Link platform and that by giving them the  refund application reference number, they would be able to speed the process. I contacted Go to Gate and they told me that they had already requested thorugh the platform but there wasn't any reference number. I demand to know refund application reference number and my money back.

"#### Beware #### this Company is in association with bookings.com and both are truly terrible moral less companies with awful customer services ..Booked a flight with gotogate 8 months ago , payment taken by booking.com. The flight kept getting rescheduled to a later time and in the end we had to cancel it as was our right for a full refund. . The booking reference given to us by gotogate has letters in the reference so you can't actually speak to anyone personally as you cant put the reference into the automated service .We have done everything through emails.. after 20 or 30 emails asking for our money back they have completely stopped emailing back hoping we will forget about our refund. We have spoken to.the airline (Scoot airways) who were excellent i might add , and they refunded booking.com over 5 months ago .If you go to the Facebook page Gotogate.com victims of the scam ,you will see all the hassle of people trying to get refunds If you want to purchase anything from these foreign companies please beware that if anything does go wrong or is cancelled your be struggling to get any resolution or money back.Please also look at the trust pilot reviews for booking.com makes the 4.7☆ self portrayed reviews look false ...🤔Have used booking.com for years and never had a problem until last year when they cancelled our hotel 3 days before our holiday to Rome,  after taking payment 9 months earlier... had to pay double for a new hotel 3 miles further out with no explanation as to why .. had other hassles now with them so won't use again .. My advice... Try to book direct with airlines and hotels ... dealing with these unscrupulous companies is no good for your health .☆☆☆☆☆HI this is my response to the ridiculous statement below from gotogate replying to my original review..Your full of 💩💩💩You did nothing . Refund yea right 🤥I contacted my bank back in December to tell them all the hassle we've had and although over six months since I purchased the flight tickets they refunded us on the understanding we send them all the proof .. which we did .. Barclays were really good considering it had gone past the 180 days since purchase date .. they then told us that they're was an attempt to take a payment  out of my account by booking.com...at the end of January... so you never refunded anything but tried to steal it back .

"If you value your time, money, and sanity, **NEVER** book a flight through GotoGate. This company is nothing more than a scam operation hiding behind fake positive reviews. They lure you in with seemingly cheap prices, but in reality, you’ll end up paying FAR MORE than booking directly with the airline—and I learned this the hard way.  I booked a multi-flight from **Osaka to Istanbul** through these fraudsters, only to find myself stranded in **Dubai airport, out of pocket for extra costs, and stuck in a never-ending nightmare with their utterly useless customer service.**  #### **Deceptive Booking & ""Guaranteed"" Connection – A Total LIE!**  GotoGate sold me an itinerary with an **impossible** connection time in Dubai—**1 hour and 30 minutes** to change terminals, exit the terminal, collect luggage, check in, go through security, and board a new flight. **IMPOSSIBLE!**  What they **failed** to mention was that my connecting flights were in **different terminals**, requiring **shuttle buses that take nearly an hour**. When my first flight landed slightly late, I had no chance of making the connection. By the time I arrived at the gate, the flight had ALREADY TAKEN OFF!  When I spoke to Dubai airport staff, they outright told me that **selling flight connections under 2 hours in Dubai is ILLEGAL.** This means **GotoGate is knowingly selling ILLEGAL and IMPOSSIBLE connections to unsuspecting travelers!**  #### **Customer Service? More Like a Robot Zoo!**  After missing my flight, I immediately contacted GotoGate’s so-called “support team” (if you can even call it that). What followed was **a masterclass in incompetence, deception, and total disregard for customers.**  - I called **15+ times**, being **lied to over and over again** by different agents.  - Some guy named **Abdul** promised me a flight for 8:30 AM and that I’d get a confirmation within 1-2 hours. **LIE!** I stayed awake waiting for this confirmation—**it never came.**  - The next morning, a woman named **RTI** told me they were booking me a 1:30 PM flight and that I’d receive the ticket soon. **ANOTHER LIE!** I showed up at the airport—**no ticket, no booking, NOTHING.**  - The call center is outsourced to **India**, and the agents are **trained to sound like robots**, constantly repeating fake empathy scripts:    - *""I understand your frustration.""*    - *""I'm sorry for the inconvenience.""*    - *""Let me check with the concerned department.""*    **STOP LYING AND DO YOUR JOB!**  Their agents have **zero power**, zero knowledge, and **zero intention of solving your problem**. They just keep you on the phone wasting your time while draining your phone credit. **My phone bill is now more expensive than the damn flight!**  #### **Extra Costs – You’ll Pay FAR MORE Than Expected**  Because of **GotoGate's scam tactics**, I ended up:  - Paying for **a hotel** in Dubai that I never planned for.  - Paying for **taxis** back and forth from the airport.  - Spending HOURS fighting with useless customer service.  - Losing **hundreds of euros** trying to rebook a flight.  What was supposed to be a **""cheap"" ticket turned into the most EXPENSIVE and STRESSFUL travel experience of my life.**  #### **Final Warning – GotoGate Will RUIN Your Trip!**  GotoGate is not just bad—it is **a criminal operation** that should be shut down. Their business model is based on deception, false guarantees, and zero accountability.  - **They sell impossible itineraries.**  - **They lie about rebooking you.**  - **Their customer support is USELESS.**  - **You WILL end up spending MORE money in the end.**  This company is **a disgrace to the travel industry**, and I **WILL TAKE THEM TO COURT** for their fraudulent business practices. I have already gathered all the necessary evidence, and I **WILL NOT STOP until this company is held accountable.**  **Save yourself the headache—BOOK DIRECTLY WITH THE AIRLINE!**",1,Negative,value time money sanity never book flight gotogate company nothing scam operation hide behind fake positive review lure seemingly cheap price reality you ll end pay far booking directly airlineand learn hard way book multiflight osaka istanbul fraudster find strand dubai airport pocket extra cost stick neverende nightmare utterly useless customer service deceptive book guarantee connection total lie gotogate sell itinerary impossible connection time dubai hour minute change terminal exit terminal collect luggage check go security board new flight impossible fail mention connect flight different terminal require shuttle bus take nearly hour first flight land slightly late chance make connection time arrive gate flight already take speak dubai airport staff outright tell sell flight connection hour dubai illegal mean gotogate knowingly sell illegal impossible connection unsuspecte traveler customer service like robot zoo miss flight immediately contact gotogate socalle support team even call follow masterclass incompetence deception total disregard customer call time lie different agent guy name abdul promise flight i d get confirmation within hour lie stay awake waiting confirmationit never come next morning woman name rti tell book pm flight i d receive ticket soon another lie show airportno ticket book nothing call center outsource india agent train sound like robot constantly repeat fake empathy script understand frustration I m sorry inconvenience let check concerned department stop lie job agent zero power zero knowledge zero intention solve problem keep phone wasting time drain phone credit phone bill expensive damn flight extra cost you ll pay far expect gotogate scam tactic end pay hotel dubai never plan pay taxi back forth airport spending hour fight useless customer service lose hundred euro try rebook flight suppose cheap ticket turn expensive stressful travel experience life final warning gotogate ruin trip gotogate badit criminal operation shut business model base deception false guarantee zero accountability sell impossible itinerary lie rebooke customer support useless end spend money end company disgrace travel industry take court fraudulent business practice already gather necessary evidence stop company hold accountable save headachebook directly airline

"total scam that lies to you and waits until you are about to leave to send you a costly invoice that panicked travelers will pay. Do not use this company and deal with airlines directly as they do not charge absurd service fees for errors they made.

"I just booked long haul flights on Etihad with checked baggage on Gotogate, and I found the process quite straightforward, and I quickly received my travel documents. The fare was a very good price.

"We had to change the date of a flight while in Cambodia. Apart from the difficulty involved ringing when we had no active sim, just whatsapp & skype, Gotogate efficiently changed the date and it all went to plan. It would have cost much less than the £62 additional cost each to change the £86 ticket if we'd booked directly with the airline, but we opted for the cheaper price when booking months ago. I have now learnt using a third party booking is not a good idea, but no fault of Gotogate.

"Booked a fight on Aerlingus in Jan 2025 which was canceled due to weather in Dublin (our mid stop on the way to Boston from Rome).  We had to book another flight in order to return home.  Called G2G as soon as we got back from the trip.  They told me the refund might take a couple weeks.  Then sent me an email with this statement:---------------------------------------------------Important Information:- Add-ons such as travel insurance may not be refundable.- The average handling time for refunds, after receiving funds from the airline, is 6 days.- While most airlines process refunds in under 5 business days, the entire process may take 10-15 business days from the time of cancellation until we process the payout.---------------------------------------------Well that statement is clearly false.  I've called a number of times and received assurances that the refund process was underway, without any details about the specific status.  It is now March 3.  I called today, explained my situation, and have been on hold for about an hour and a half so far.  It is clear they are either understaffed or do not want to talk to me.  It sure seems as though these folks are scamming their customers. Update: March 4, 2025Phoned GotoGate today and had my call dropped three ties. In the final call, I was put on hold for over three hours.  While on hold I called G2G on a separate phone and reached Ivan.  He seemed to be doing everything possible to help resolve my issue.  He is clearly an exemplary employee.  However, due to some sort of snafu with Aerlingus, an upfront payment of $200 was claimed to be required to free up my rebate.  Of course I was skeptical and demanded a letter from G2G detailing the charges purpose in an invoice, which I did receive.  I submitted payment, with trepidation.  We’ll see.Hmmm.  It’s March 18, 2025.  Funny, I guess, still no refund.  Though I did get a ‘no-reply’ email from AerLingus saying they were working on it.  Are they?  The case seems clear to me; they cancelled the flight but do not want to refund the money.  What’s the delay?April 1, 2025: three emails promising a refund.  So far, just promises. April 6, 2025: So, the $200 went to a company called LOOKMYFLIGHT.  They sent me an email saying my refund was processed and would be refunded to my credit card.

"Disastrous handling of flight delays and cancellations. The call center professionals are kind, but the process is incredibly inefficient and time-consuming. The most ""fun"" part of the trip was when an airline cancelled one leg of my two-flight journey. I managed to reach the layover airport independently with another flight and informed Gotogate to reimburse me for the first flight but of course not the second. However, upon arrival, I discovered that Gotogate had cancelled both flights reservations, leaving me stranded.I contacted their support team, and the agent in the chat said the issue would be reviewed within 48 hours—though I had to leave in four. He was not particularly useful. Thankfully, I called another agent, who initially almost made a serious mistake due to carelessness but ultimately managed to restore my booking, allowing me to take the flights.In short, I believe Gotogate should:1. Make better use of AI to ensure calls are directed to the appropriate personnel, avoiding unnecessary transfers between departments.2. Allow clients to make changes to their bookings instead of always having to contact the call centre.3. Ensure teams communicate effectively, as they hardly ever read previous conversations.All in all, it was a disastrously mismanaged experience.",1,Negative,disastrous handling flight delay cancellation call center professional kind process incredibly inefficient timeconsuming fun part trip airline cancel one leg twoflight journey manage reach layover airport independently another flight inform gotogate reimburse first flight course second however upon arrival discover gotogate cancel flight reservation leave strandedi contact support team agent chat say issue would review within hoursthough leave four particularly useful thankfully call another agent initially almost make serious mistake due carelessness ultimately manage restore booking allow take flightsin short believe gotogate make well use ai ensure call direct appropriate personnel avoid unnecessary transfer department allow client make change booking instead always contact call centre ensure team communicate effectively hardly ever read previous conversationsall disastrously mismanage experience

"***UPDATE:I did in fact stay in touch with them to see if they would finally sort my reimbursement out. No such luck. I received an email saying I was not eligible for the claim, even though they specifically say I bought the service through them. Now I have to hope the airline does something about it (again), but to be honest, it all seems like a long shot. You can't reply to that last email from GoToGate, because for them, the case is closed and that's it. So there you go. Unacceptable.I find it incredible that they can sell a service they're clearly not in a position to provide and then simply refuse to reimburse you for it. That surely qualifies as a scam, doesn't it?Anyway, like my tag line here says: AVOID!------------AVOID.In October last year I bought tickets through them to fly to Mexico in January. I paid to reserve a window seat with extra leg room, which was £100 each way.When it was time to fly out, it turns out the seat I had reserved almost three months before was not respected, and I was assigned a middle seat without the extra leg room. I complained, of course, but with the flight full, the airline didn't do anything. From here, there are two main issues:1- I first tried to get a refund from the airline, which was not doable in the end because I bought the ticket through this third-party provider. But what I discovered is that the airline charged £75 for the seat, not £100, so GoToGate had charged an extra £25 for the seat that the airline would not have been able to refund even if I had been able to do it through them. When you book the seats with GoToGate, it does NOT itemise that the cost is also from them, or how much is charged by each party. I had to go through many hoops to even get in touch with their customer service and find this out, and when I finally managed, the girl in the chat was quite rude and they didn't even provide me with an itemised bill for what I had paid for the tickets and seats so I could discuss it further with the airline (at that point, I was still hoping the airline would sort it out).2- Once the airline made it clear they could not sort it out because it was bought externally, I tried contacting GoToGate again, which this time I ended up doing over the phone, as the chat option was not available. I was told that the seat reservations are non-refundable. I obviously made a fuss, because paying for the seats is not mandatory, and if you're paying for a service they're not providing, they should refund you. There was a lot of back and forth there, and they now ""might"" look into my case, for which I have to fill out a form and send out who knows how much supporting evidence and simply hope for a good outcome.I've learned my lesson, though.

"This company is a scam. I booked flights from Athens to Istanbul on 2 June, only to find the confirmation came back as 27/5. When I contacted them they help desk to fix this they said I could change the date for $77 AUD. They flights cost 230 so thought ok, maybe I made a mistake. Transferred the money. Received confirmation email, flights still on 27/5. Was told they would update in an hour and I’d get an email. Got an email confirmation saying id need to pay a further $277 if I wanted to change the flights. So now I am thinking scam. Called them they help support desk. Booking.com is actually Gotogate. Apparently based in Stockholm. They tell me the flights have gone up so I need to pay the extra. I look on Pegasus who the flights are through. Flight is available for 58 euro. I tell the support person I am not will to give them a cent more and ask to escalate to the manager . He tries the same excuse. I demand my money is refunded for the extra and the flight changed.

"I used Go-Gate (via Booking.com) to book a flight from Europe to Africa. I made a change on my original booking (where i paid a change fee) and this is where the nightmare began. The night before my departure i found it strange that I couldnt check in. I then contacted Go-Gate only to be told that i must pay another £800 to travel (not forgetting i had already been issued new tickets and paid a change fee)- which was strange as they issued me a new ticket and took payment for the change originally. After phoning close to 7 times and being told a supervisor will call me back with my family waiting at the airport - no one ever did. I spent hours on hold and calling back and I was told the issue was escalated, but no one ever contacted me back, despite multiple promises (and all calls are recorded to prove this). I must have been on hold to their call centre for hours and the customer service was very poor. Eventually i was told that it was Go-Gates error (recorded call) and a refund will be issued. Its been over 2 weeks now, and i am yet to receive a refund. In fact all i see on their website is that ""the airline is determining the refund"". To be clear this is not the airline's fault but Go Gates fault and i am expecting a full refund of my original ticket and my change fee - and any refund for me has nothing to do with the airline's policy as this was GoGates mistake. The customer service was poor to begin with, i have been waiting weeks for a refund - do you call that customer service? Horrible experience and as someone in customer service myself a case study of how not to engage customers that i will use.What was funny was GoGate said they cancelled the tickets, but i still got ""CheckIn notifications"" so after firstly not changing my ticket, they probably never cancelled the cancellation - craziest mess i have ever seen. I am expecting a full refund along with my change fee - let’s see if this at least can be done properly before they lose a customer.Update 19 March: it’s been over 6 weeks now, no refund, no communication, despite confirmation they would get back to me I have heard nothing",1,Negative,use gogate via bookingcom book flight europe africa make change original booking pay change fee nightmare begin night departure find strange could not check contact gogate tell must pay another travel forget already issue new ticket pay change fee strange issue new ticket take payment change originally phone close time tell supervisor call back family wait airport one ever spend hour hold call back tell issue escalate one ever contact back despite multiple promise call record prove must hold call centre hour customer service poor eventually tell gogate error record call refund issue week yet receive refund fact see website airline determine refund clear airline fault go gate fault expect full refund original ticket change fee refund nothing airline policy gogate mistake customer service poor begin wait week refund call customer service horrible experience someone customer service case study engage customer usewhat funny gogate say cancel ticket still get checkin notification firstly change ticket probably never cancel cancellation craziest mess ever see expect full refund along change fee let see least do properly lose customerupdate march week refund communication despite confirmation would get back hear nothing

"Disappointing Experience with Booking.com, Emirates, and GotogateI recently encountered a major issue with my family’s flight booking (Reservation Code: ETPKV2, booked on January 15, 2025) that resulted in significant financial loss and emotional distress. During online check-in on January 19, 2025, I discovered our surname was mistakenly entered as “Oezcam” instead of “Özçam.” Despite multiple calls to both Emirates and Gotogate, each company blamed the other, and no corrective action was taken. Consequently, we were marked as “no show,” and I was forced to repurchase tickets at an extra cost of approximately $6,300.I’m sharing this experience as a caution to all travelers: always double-check your booking details and be prepared for the possibility of poor customer support.

"I booked flights through Booking.com, completely unaware that the actual agent handling my booking was GoToGate. The airline later made significant changes to my flights, switching them from direct to non-direct. As a result, I received an official email from the airline stating that I was entitled to a full refund. However, since I had booked through an agent, I was required to go through them to process it.That’s when the nightmare began.I first contacted Booking.com over a week ago, and I have since had multiple calls and chats, yet I am still no closer to getting any confirmation about my refund. Every call is met with vague, useless responses, and absolutely no progress is made.On one call, they had the audacity to instruct me to contact the airline because—according to them—there was a “technical issue” between their system and the airline’s, preventing them from handling my refund. Of course, when I called the airline, they confirmed this was complete nonsense. The problem isn’t with the airline—it’s with Booking.com and GoToGate.I’ve even followed up multiple times, and still, no confirmation of if or when I’ll actually see my refund. At this point, it is blatantly obvious that they are deliberately stalling and avoiding their responsibility.

"I have been a loyal customer of gotogate.com for more than 5 years. I trust they will keep me inform in case of flight cancelation but never encounter any cancellation until my recent experience. Below is my chronology of event on 7th Feb 2025...7.50pm 7.2.2025 We connect to Tap Airline Flight TP87 Lisbon to Sao Paulo from Milan and upon arrival to Lisbon, we noticed on the screen this connecting flight TP87 is cancelled. Horrified and not knowing what to do, i and my son scheme the entire Lisbon airport to know what we supposed to do as we have a connecting flight at Sao Paulo airport to Santiago. No whatsapp nor emails from gotogate thus far.. We finally understood that we have to get out to the main terminal and search for Tap Airline counter for cancelation. Tap Airline ground staff rerouted our flight to Rio De Janeiro departing almost the same date and time as Sao Paulo. Due to this rerouting all the flights paid for Sao Paulo to Santiago is burned. We have to pay new flights connecting to Santiago from Rio De Janeiro. Tired, defeated and hungry, myself and my son have no choice but to relent our disappointment of gotogate as the Travel Agent we have trusted more than 5 years. Not only the enormous amount of money burned (original flight and buying new tickets) but in this case not a single email nor whatsapp from gotogate in regards to this flight cancelation.

Lack of Support: When I encountered issues with my booking, I reached out for assistance, only to be met with unhelpful responses and long wait times. The customer service representatives seemed poorly trained and unable to provide any real solutions.2. Refund Issues: After facing unexpected circumstances that led to the cancellation of my flight, I was promised a refund. However, weeks have passed without any updates or the refund itself. The lack of communication has left me feeling abandoned and frustrated.3. Confusing Processes: The website is not user-friendly, making it difficult to find essential information regarding my booking and the refund process. This added to my stress during an already challenging time.4. Overall Experience: I had high hopes when I booked my travel through Gotogate, but the reality has been far from satisfactory.

I have booked with them 3 flights under one booking. 4 weeks before my flights I have received email that one of my flights have been cancelled I contacted them and asked if there is any other flight that they can give me instead. They said no. I have done my research and found a flight with same air line but to different airport London instead of Birmingham as my original booking. Then they have told me it is impossible to change an air port. And then they have told me there is nothing they can do. I have asked if I will get a refund for this flight they said I am only eligible for refund if I cancel the whole booking. I have paid £750 and they offered £633 as refund. I have tried booking flight separately- the one that has been cancelled- but it was coming up to £300-400 which to me seemed like a lot of money on top of £750 that I already paid.

I have now been waiting 9 weeks for my refund and despite KLM confirming they have processed this, GTG still won't give me my refund saying the airline haven't paid them back yet.

"Updated Review Title: Terrible Experience – Partial Tax “Refund” for Airline-Cancelled FlightI recently received a reply from GoToGate regarding my airline-cancelled flight. Their response claimed that the airline “only authorized a refund of the tax amount,” rather than the full fare. This is either complete nonsense or outright illegal. When an airline cancels a flight, EU Regulation 261/2004 clearly states travelers are entitled to a full refund, not just a reimbursement of taxes.Moreover, if the flight never happened, it’s puzzling how they justify refunding only “taxes.” The entire amount should be returned—after all, if the plane was canceled, what taxes are there to pay?This handling reinforces my view that GoToGate’s customer service and refund processes are both inadequate and potentially in violation of EU regulations. I’m continuing legal action to recover my full payment, but in the meantime, I strongly advise anyone considering GoToGate to look elsewhere. This experience has been a costly lesson I hope others can avoid.I Title: Terrible Experience - No Refund for Airline-Cancelled Flight a truly frustrating experience…I had a truly frustrating experience with GoToGate, and I feel compelled to warn other travelers. I booked a flight through GoToGate, and the airline canceled the flight – not me. Under EU Regulation 261/2004, I am entitled to a full refund because the airline initiated the cancellation. However, GoToGate refused to provide the refund, claiming that my ticket was non-refundable.I’ve been waiting for over a month, and despite numerous emails and attempts to contact them, I still haven't received my money back. Their customer service is unhelpful, sending generic responses and demanding consent to process my data before even addressing my issue. They also make it extremely difficult to reach a real person, with phone lines and chat options limited by location.To make matters worse, they claim they can only refund taxes, not the full amount – which is completely against EU regulations for airline-initiated cancellations. This is unacceptable and feels like a scam.I urge others to avoid using GoToGate at all costs. If something goes wrong with your flight, don’t expect any support or a fair resolution. I will never use this company again, and I am now pursuing legal action to get my money back.",1,Negative,update review title terrible experience partial tax refund airlinecancelle flighti recently receive reply gotogate regard airlinecancelle flight response claim airline authorize refund tax amount rather full fare either complete nonsense outright illegal airline cancel flight eu regulation clearly state traveler entitle full refund reimbursement taxesmoreover flight never happen puzzle justify refund taxis entire amount returnedafter plane cancel taxis paythi handling reinforce view gotogate customer service refund process inadequate potentially violation eu regulation I m continue legal action recover full payment meantime strongly advise anyone consider gotogate look elsewhere experience costly lesson hope other avoidi title terrible experience refund airlinecancelle flight truly frustrating experiencei truly frustrating experience gotogate feel compel warn traveler book flight gotogate airline cancel flight eu regulation entitle full refund airline initiate cancellation however gotogate refuse provide refund claim ticket nonrefundableive waiting month despite numerous email attempt contact still have not receive money back customer service unhelpful send generic response demand consent process datum even address issue also make extremely difficult reach real person phone line chat option limit locationto make matter bad claim refund taxis full amount completely eu regulation airlineinitiate cancellation unacceptable feel like scami urge other avoid use gotogate cost something go wrong flight do not expect support fair resolution never use company pursue legal action get money back

"I made the mistake of booking flights through booking.com. The flight element is powered by Go To Gate which I was not aware of at the time of booking. The integration does not work properly. When I booked I  was aware that I might need to add additional luggage etc, but assumed that I could do that at check in, direct with the airline. My booking on booking.com showed no luggage on the way out, and cabin bags on the way in - which was a little confusing, but anyway no problem, I logged into the airlines system, however it directed me back to booking.com, where I eventually found a phone number which is actually the phone number for Go To Gate. From there it just go worse and worse - it tuned out that what I could see on the screen on my booking.com account did not match with the information that Go To Gate had - one the way out I had no luggage, on the way back I had 2 x hold luggage and 2 x cabin bag per person! They tried to tell me that's what I had booked - who would book that?? To solve the issue I asked them to add cabin bags on the way out, and was prepared to pay. The phone payment appeared to be a scam to my bank so they held the payment. I was then sent a link to Go To Gate, with the luggage selected, although the person on the phone could not tell me exactly what luggage it was - just that it was 3 bags. I completed the payment. Once the phone call terminated, I was then able to explore the go to gate link in more detail - it turned out that I could have selected the cabin bags that I wanted, for less money than I paid, what I actually was sold was hold luggage. I have since complained to Go To Gate and asked them to amend the booking, they just sent standard 'we are looking into it' responses but haven't actually done anything, and appear to have no intention of doing anything given that its nearly time for the flight. I have managed to check in direct with the airline, and everything on that side seems to be OK, but I feel Id have been better off just booking direct with the airline or with other flight providers who do have working integrations with the airlines and their own platforms.

"This feels like a scam, though it is not.I bought a ticket that can be changed. Up to 24h before departure.When I tried to do so 48h before first online I was informed i had to call. So when I called I was informed my case has been passed to the service team. And that they would get back to me within 24h.I told them that this made no sense as there was a risk they would get back after the limit of 24h. But to no avail. I called twice with the same result.They ended up sending me an email 4am in the morning that I should react to within 1h or the ticket was lost.

"I booked flights through Gotogate and had an incredibly frustrating experience due to their serious booking errors and complete lack of customer support.My travel companion, was initially booked on the correct flights but in economy instead of premium economy, which we had paid for. When I contacted Gotogate to fix this, their agent eventually rebooked her, BUT on the wrong flights—both outbound and return! This was a long-haul journey from Paris to Bangkok, making the mistake even more unacceptable.I immediately contacted Gotogate for help, but they were completely unresponsive. With our flight just one day away, I had no choice but to call Air France directly and pay £289 out of pocket to correct Gotogate’s mistake.Gotogate caused this issue, yet they refuse to respond to my compensation request. I have submitted multiple complaints, but they ignore emails and offer zero customer support once they have your money.I paid £1,940.99 in total for this trip, only to be left stranded fixing their errors.

"I purchased plane tickets from the Booking.com portal, but it appears that Booking.com acts as a payment platform in this case, and the tickets were actually sold by Gotogate. The tickets were for my and my wife's trip to Vietnam with a connection in China in November last year. Unfortunately, the airline cancelled second flight (from China to Vietnam). I received confirmation from the airline stating that all unused flights are refundable due to the cancellation, but the refund must be requested via the travel agent who sold me the tickets.I requested a refund from Gotogate in November and received a confirmation email that the flights were entitled to a refund and that the refund would be provided within the next few weeks. However, three months later, I am still waiting. I have been on the chat with Gotogate support multiple times during these three months, and every time I am advised to wait another few weeks.Furthermore, I spoke with the airline, and they informed me they cannot see the refund request from Gotogate, and Gotogate support refuses to contact the airline to check why. While Gotogate might offer good prices, if something goes wrong, it is very unlikely you will get any support.

While the payment for £977 was being processed by PayPal, the price had increased by £88 without prior notification or giving me the option to cancel or proceed on price increase. This is unlawful and fraudulent and I am very distressed. I spoke to Gotogate and asked for either cancellation and full refund or to refund the price increase of £88 taken unlawfully without my consent and they said tickets not confirmed yet and I need to wait for airline to get back although my email says flights are confirmed.

"Do not book with this company! My flights were cancelled just as we were about to board due to bad weather. I request a refund the same day via go to gate and was assured I would have refund as soon as the airline sent the refund. This didn’t happen. I had to contact the airline myself months later and only then did go to gate refund me. They did zero to help me and made me wait months for £830 refund!!Following the reply below from Go to Gate, the only reason I got the refund was because I sorted it out myself as Go to Gate were useless. They promised the refund in 15 days, yet once this date passed and I called them, I was told that they could not tell me when I would receive the refund and that they had not even contacted the airline to request a refund. As such I contacted the airline myself and the refund was issued to me via Go to Gate on the 11th February. Go to Gate were absolutely useless and had I not taken the initiative to contact Vueling myself, I have no idea if I ever would have received the refund, from other reviews I have read of people waiting years for a refund, I doubt I would have.

"I recently had a horrible and fraudulent experience with Gotogate while trying to rebook my flight from Paris to Mauritius due to a family emergency. My original flight was on February 20, 2025, but I needed to change it to either February 17 or 18. Initially, I wanted to rebook directly through Air Mauritius, but when I contacted their Helpdesk, I was told that since I had booked through Gotogate, only Gotogate could handle the rebooking, and Air Mauritius was unable to assist me. This was the only reason I had to go through Gotogate in the first place, which turned out to be a huge mistake.When I checked Gotogate’s website, I saw that I could rebook for £370 on February 18 at 18:10, but when I asked the agent, he refused to let me book it, claiming it was not available for rebooking. However, I could see that the exact same flight was available for rebooking on Air Mauritius’ website, proving that the agent was lying. I believe that he did not let me book it as I had seen that the re-booking should cost £370, and hence he would not be able to scam me. Instead, he found another option for February 17 and tried to charge me £700, even though I later found out that the same flight was listed on Air Mauritius’ website for €489 (~£400).Adding to the scam, the airline's fare rules stated that changes for my flight (MK14) should cost £166, yet the agent could not explain why they were charging me £700. When I repeatedly asked for a breakdown of the costs and official documentation, he kept dodging my questions and instead repeated the same scripted responses without providing any valid justification. He initially said their service fee was £35, yet suddenly, the total amount became £700 without a clear explanation. At one point, he even quoted €714, then switched it to GBP, clearly trying to manipulate the currency for extra profit. His behavior became unprofessional and condescending, as he took ages to respond, yet when I demanded clarification, he pressured me to make a decision within 3 minutes, claiming the chat was taking too long—even though I had to wait 15+ minutes for each of his replies. His tone was sarcastic and dismissive, even addressing me in a belittling way: “I will repeat it once again for you, Ishika,” when all I was asking for was basic transparency on the price.After a two-hour back-and-forth, where I refused to pay without official documentation, the agent still refused to provide any proof of the charges. He abruptly ended the chat. The next day, when I tried to log in to my Gotogate account, I found that it had been blocked, likely in an attempt to erase evidence of the chat so that I couldn’t use it for complaints or legal action. However, they failed to cover their tracks because I took screenshots of the entire chat yesterday. I also have a picture of the exact same flight Gotogate tried to charge me £700 for, clearly listed at £400 on Air Mauritius’ official website, proving that they were trying to scam me out of £300. They lied about availability, inflated the price for their own profit, manipulated currency conversions, and refused to provide receipts or price breakdowns. Their rude and aggressive tactics, refusal to provide transparency, and deliberate attempt to erase evidence make them an extremely shady company. I will be taking action against them and reporting them to the relevant authorities. I strongly urge everyone to avoid Gotogate and always book directly with the airline to avoid being scammed.",1,Negative,recently horrible fraudulent experience gotogate try rebook flight paris mauritius due family emergency original flight february need change either february initially want rebook directly air mauritius contact helpdesk tell since book gotogate gotogate could handle rebooke air mauritius unable assist reason go gotogate first place turn huge mistakewhen check gotogate website see could rebook february ask agent refuse let book claim available rebooking however could see exact flight available rebooke air mauritius website prove agent lying believe let book see rebooke cost hence would able scam instead find another option february try charge even though later find flight list air mauritius website add scam airline fare rule state change flight mk cost yet agent could explain charge repeatedly ask breakdown cost official documentation keep dodge question instead repeat scripted response without provide valid justification initially say service fee yet suddenly total amount become without clear explanation one point even quote switch gbp clearly try manipulate currency extra profit behavior become unprofessional condescending take age respond yet demand clarification pressured make decision within minute claim chat take longeven though wait minute reply tone sarcastic dismissive even address belittle way repeat ishika ask basic transparency priceafter twohour backandforth refuse pay without official documentation agent still refuse provide proof charge abruptly end chat next day try log gotogate account find block likely attempt erase evidence chat could not use complaint legal action however fail cover track take screenshot entire chat yesterday also picture exact flight gotogate try charge clearly list air mauritius official website prove try scam lie availability inflate price profit manipulate currency conversion refuse provide receipt price breakdown rude aggressive tactic refusal provide transparency deliberate attempt erase evidence make extremely shady company take action report relevant authority strongly urge everyone avoid gotogate always book directly airline avoid scamme

"Terrible Customer Service and Endless Refund DelaysI’m not the type to leave bad reviews, but after my experience with Gotogate/Booking.com, I feel responsible for warning others. If you ever end up in a similar situation, be prepared for a nightmare.My flight was changed multiple times (not Gotogate’s fault), so I contacted them to find an alternative. They couldn’t provide one, which I completely understand. However, they explicitly told me that I could cancel my ticket and receive a full refund. Based on this assurance, I purchased a new ticket for £500 on top of the original £800 I had already spent, thinking I’d get my money back.A few days later, I received an email stating that I wasn’t entitled to a full refund, and that’s when the chaos started. It has now been over a month, and I’ve been stuck in an endless loop of phone calls and emails with different agents giving me conflicting information, different refund amounts, and countless excuses. They keep postponing the process or refusing to clarify if I’ll actually get my full refund.For such a large company, a refund should not take this long, especially when they were the ones who misled me in the first place. Because of this, I ended up spending way more money than planned—paying for a new flight, hotel, and additional travel expenses. I’ve spoken to four different agents just this week, and I still have no clear answer on when (or if) I’ll see my refund.At this point, I’m joking that I’ll probably receive it after getting married and having three kids! But seriously, this whole ordeal has been stressful, time-consuming, and costly.My advice?Book directly with the airline and avoid third-party services like Gotogate/Booking.com.

"A complete rip-off. They will entice you with lower prices flights, but then charge you abusive fees for any change/add-on. Want to pay £215 per person to add checked baggage? £41 for the privilege of selecting your seats, as well as double the seat price the airline charges on their own website - all the while saying that’s the airline’s fee. Plus, their T&Cs state you are merely expressing a preference and not actually securing your seats, as they can be changed by the airline at any moment without compensation! Forget doing anything directly with the airline as well, as buying a ticket with them will stop you from being able to do it. They even charge £22 extra if you want to claim compensation if your flight is delayed! Something that happens automatically in case of delays. There is simply no transparency regarding extra costs and it's full of hidden fees.

"Maybe you will save a little money with them. But if anything unexpected happens then customer support is terrible. Their chat support is intermittently available, not 24/7. You can wait forever to be connected to a human. And if you don’t reply within 3 minutes they cut you off. The agents have no power to resolve anything if they can’t select the standard icons on their screen to do it. Calling their support line? Forget it. Long wait will eat your roaming minutes, sometimes cut you off while waiting and when you do get through they give the same options. Background: I booked Thai Airways to Manila through Gotogate. After travelling out ok Thai Airways cancelled one of my return flights and booked me on a much earlier one. Due to another separate trip booking with a return flight from Osaka it was impossible for me to catch this. There was an easy solution available with a Thai flight Osaka to Bangkok to connect with my existing Bangkoknto London booking. However, Gotogate refused to do anything except book the same route 1 day later or cancel and refund. They referred me to Thai Airways.

"For the past twenty years, I have primarily purchased airline tickets through Expedia.com or directly from major airlines. With so many online ticket sellers, it’s hard to know which ones are trustworthy. Initially, I was hesitant to use Gotogate due to some negative Google reviews, but my experience turned out to be exceptional.In November of last year, I booked an international ticket for my wife and me. Unfortunately, in January, my wife had to cancel her trip due to her mother’s declining health. Since the ticket was non-refundable, I reached out to Gotogate.com, hoping for a possible solution.From the customer service representative to their manager, everyone I interacted with was incredibly understanding and professional. While Gotogate cannot make final decisions regarding refunds, they acted as a dedicated middle service provider. They immediately reached out to Cathay Pacific Airways on my behalf and worked diligently to find a resolution. Within just a few days, they secured a very reasonable and satisfactory outcome. I was particularly impressed that Gotogate waived their service fees and handled all communications seamlessly.Their excellent communication skills and commitment to customer service truly stood out. Because of this positive experience, I am giving Gotogate.com the highest rating on Google Reviews. They proved to be a reliable and professional service provider, and I highly recommend them!",5,Positive,past twenty year primarily purchase airline ticket expediacom directly major airline many online ticket seller hard know one trustworthy initially hesitant use gotogate due negative google review experience turn exceptionalin november last year book international ticket wife unfortunately january wife cancel trip due mother decline health since ticket nonrefundable reach gotogatecom hope possible solutionfrom customer service representative manager everyone interact incredibly understand professional gotogate make final decision regard refund act dedicated middle service provider immediately reach cathay pacific airways behalf worked diligently find resolution within day secure reasonable satisfactory outcome particularly impressed gotogate waive service fee handle communication seamlesslytheir excellent communication skill commitment customer service truly stand positive experience give gotogatecom high rating google review prove reliable professional service provider highly recommend

"I booked a Manila to Singapore flight with Philippine Airlines through Gotogate for £143 (booking number 1045-907-145) including their so-called FlexiTicket, which supposedly allows easy flight changes for just the fare difference. When I requested to change my flight from 19th February to 24th February, I was quoted an outrageous £131 fare difference per person. At first, I thought, maybe it's a peak season price, but after checking myself on Gotogate’s own website, I found the flight was half that price. They were deliberately inflating the cost and scamming me out of extra money.To make matters worse, I checked the flight price multiple times that day and even after they quoted me the double-inflated price, and it was STILL showing half the cost.......even on their own website! In reality, the flight was around £55 per person, yet they tried to charge me nearly £300 in total for two flights that should have cost just £110! (the original FlexiTicket price plus the real cost of the new flight).Gotogate Lied & Refused to Change My FlightAfter three separate live chat conversations, they kept delaying, saying my request needed to be ""escalated"" to another team. 72 hours later, still no response, yet they are quick enough to reply in TrustPilot for a negative review.Today, when I checked again, I saw the flight was still available on their website, yet they told me on live chat that no flights existed! This proves they are intentionally lying to customers to block flight changes and force people into paying even more.Filing a Chargeback & Reporting ThemSince they are refusing to process my flight change, I am now:✔️ Filing a chargeback with my credit card provider for ""services not provided.""✔️ Reporting Gotogate to European Consumer Services for failing to honor a paid service.✔️ Leaving this review so others don’t fall for their scam.Their customer service is useless, their FlexiTicket is a lie, and they are blatantly misleading customers to squeeze more money out of them.

"Not only did they scam me, but I am also stuck in Mumbai for a day and a night. I bought this ticket only seeing a 4 hours transit. When I found out that my flight from Heathrow was delayed by nine hours, I was already at the airport. I called Go to Gate customer service, and a woman named Riya (a scammer) answered my call.After two hours of back-and-forth, they charged my card twice under the pretense of ""verification."" I wasn’t sure why they kept verifying, but I was desperate to change to a different flight. After all this, when I realized they had charged me around £3,000, I called them back. They claimed it was a mistake and assured me the money would be refunded within an hour—but that was a lie.After I left the UK, my wife contacted the same Go to Gate number, and they denied that I had ever called them. I had clearly spoken to scammers. What I don’t understand is how my call to their official landline was redirected to fraudsters.

"The thing about GoToGate, which is echoed all over this site, is that as long as your booking does NOT require human intervention you might be OK. However, the minute you have to go to that help desk to change anything like a flight re-schedule, you are going to find it a nightmare.They pick up the phone quickly, but that is the only thing that goes right. The actual call centre staff will not help you. Instead, they will string you along, giving you a different story each time ( one could call that deliberate lying ). Sure sir this will be sorted for you , please be patient while we sit back with your money and do nothing at all..... Probably about the worst call centre experience I have ever had.AVOID and book direct with the airline if there is the slightest chance you might want to change anything post the booking.",1,Negative,thing gotogate echoed site long booking require human intervention might ok however minute go help desk change anything like flight reschedule go find nightmarethey pick phone quickly thing go right actual call centre staff help instead string along give different story time one could call deliberate lie sure sir sort please patient sit back money nothing probably worst call centre experience ever hadavoid book direct airline slight chance might want change anything post booking

"This company provided the worst customer service experience I've ever encountered.While I initially booked flights through booking.com, I later discovered they use Gotogate for ticketing.  Two weeks ago, the airline cancelled our outbound flight and move us to the following day, a completely unusable option.  Despite available flights on the original date with codeshare airlines, Gotogate or Japan Airline failed to transfer us. Worse, during a phone call with their representative, incorrect dates were submitted to the airline, which Gotogate then denied, ultimately leading to the cancellation of my outbound flight.  I'm now thousands of pounds out of pocket with no outbound flight.  Gotogate simply blames the airline, while the airline claims they can't assist because the booking was made through an agency.  This endless cycle of blame highlights an outdated and inadequate process between Gotogate and the airlines for handling flight changes after a schedule alteration.  This has been, without a doubt, the most stressful and frustrating customer experience imaginable.",1,Negative,company provide bad customer service experience I ve ever encounteredwhile initially book flight bookingcom later discover use gotogate ticketing two week ago airline cancel outbound flight move we follow day completely unusable option despite available flight original date codeshare airline gotogate japan airline fail transfer we bad phone call representative incorrect date submit airline gotogate deny ultimately lead cancellation outbound flight I m thousand pound pocket outbound flight gotogate simply blame airline airline claim can not assist book make agency endless cycle blame highlight outdate inadequate process gotogate airline handle flight change schedule alteration without doubt stressful frustrating customer experience imaginable

"Short story: I paid for a plane ticket, a name change, and for a new ticket to be issued. The new ticket was never issued, and I had to buy a new ticket worth twice the price at the airport on the day of the flight. I complained to the company the same day the issue happened and I have yet to receive feedback or a refund for what now appears to have been a fraudulent transaction. Details: I helped my two aunts to book tickets from Johannesburg to Barcelona in August of 2024 for a flight in December of 2024. One of the aunt's surname was mistakenly incorrectly spelled. I emailed Go-To-Gate to request a name change and paid GBP35. This request was reportedly denied by the airline, and I was refunded and advised to instead seek a complete rebooking of the ticket, with the initial cost of the flight recognised as credit. on 12 October, I phoned Go-to-Gate, and was connected to The Fly Ticket LTD who confirmed on the phone that they manage Go-To-Gate bookings, and could assist with a re-booking. I was eventually charged GBP 210 for the reissuance of the ticket, and sent confirmation. About 3 weeks later, I received a document with a new booking confirmation and e-ticket number that both reflected the name change. I was able to log into the booking on Lufthansa and verify that the name had indeed been changed on the booking - it was successfully changed, booking reference TNHK5N. On the day of the flight at the airport my aunt was informed that she was not able to check in because the name on the ticket did not match the passport. the Lufthansa airport system had not registered a name change despite the change reflecting on the website under the aforementioned booking. I called both Lufthansa and Go-To-Gate/FlyTicket for assistance before boarding. The two companies effectively argued that it was the other's responsibility to change the issuance of the corrected ticket - leaving my aunt as the customer effectively powerless and stranded. My aunt was forced to buy an entirely new ticket, which cost twice the amount of the original ticket. We immediately requested a refund  to be processed on the new ticket given it had to be forcibly bought in lieu of a solution between the agent and the airline. It is now February, 2 months later, after numerous phone calls and emails to enquire about the status of the refund, we have been given no formal paperwork confirming the escalation of the refund. I would caution anyone travelling not to use this service AT ALL - we seem to have been duped by systems that appeared completely legitimate but effectively made one fraudulent transaction, paying for a ticket which could not be used, and then forced to pay for another at 100% premium, with no acknowledgement of wrongdoing or commitment to rectify this on the part of Go-To-Gate, FlyTicket or Lufthansa whose systems showed a rectified ticket but who did not let my aunt fly after all.  There are some clear operational issues that have nothing to do with the customer, and neither of these parties are taking responsibility to support us. I would like immediate support on this issue and am looking to escalate to an ombud.",1,Negative,short story pay plane ticket name change new ticket issue new ticket never issue buy new ticket worth twice price airport day flight complain company day issue happen yet receive feedback refund appear fraudulent transaction detail help two aunt book ticket johannesburg barcelona august flight december one aunt surname mistakenly incorrectly spell email gotogate request name change pay gbp request reportedly deny airline refunded advise instead seek complete rebooking ticket initial cost flight recognise credit october phone gotogate connect fly ticket ltd confirm phone manage gotogate booking could assist rebooke eventually charge gbp reissuance ticket send confirmation week later receive document new booking confirmation eticket number reflect name change able log book lufthansa verify name indeed change booking successfully change booking reference tnhkn day flight airport aunt inform able check name ticket match passport lufthansa airport system register name change despite change reflect website aforementioned booking call lufthansa gotogateflyticket assistance board two company effectively argue other responsibility change issuance correct ticket leave aunt customer effectively powerless strand aunt force buy entirely new ticket cost twice amount original ticket immediately request refund process new ticket give forcibly buy lieu solution agent airline february month later numerous phone call email enquire status refund give formal paperwork confirm escalation refund would caution anyone travel use service seem dupe system appear completely legitimate effectively make one fraudulent transaction pay ticket could use force pay another premium acknowledgement wrongdoing commitment rectify part gotogate flyticket lufthansa whose system show rectified ticket let aunt fly clear operational issue nothing customer neither party take responsibility support we would like immediate support issue look escalate ombud

"A couple of months ago, I purchased two tickets for February 7, paying €491 per ticket, plus an additional €76 for the Flexible Re-plan option. The website clearly states that in case of a ticket change, I would only need to pay the price difference (if applicable), with no extra fees from Gotogate or the airline.Unfortunately, due to an unexpected medical condition affecting my wife, I had to reschedule our flight by a month. When I checked the website, the new ticket price was €525, meaning I should have only needed to pay around €70 extra (€30 per ticket), based on the terms stated online. However, when I proceeded with the change, I was shocked to find that Gotogate was asking for €423.I contacted customer support and, after a long wait, was told that the minimum fee they could offer was €400 (€200.30 per ticket). When I pointed out their own terms of service, they claimed that some information affecting the price is not visible on the website and is only accessible on their end. I requested to speak with a supervisor or manager, but they only provided a generic customer support number and an email.Frustrated, I checked the website again—just an hour later—and suddenly the prices had changed again. This time, I was able to rebook my flight for an extra €224 in total. The entire experience made it clear that the real criteria behind these charges are completely vague and invisible to customers!!!!!Lesson learned: There’s always a hidden price behind ""cheaper"" options, and it often comes in the form of stress, frustration, and unexpected costs.",1,Negative,couple month ago purchase two ticket february pay per ticket plus additional flexible replan option website clearly state case ticket change would need pay price difference applicable extra fee gotogate airlineunfortunately due unexpected medical condition affect wife reschedule flight month check website new ticket price mean need pay around extra per ticket base term state online however proceed change shock find gotogate asking contact customer support long wait tell minimum fee could offer per ticket point term service claim information affect price visible website accessible end request speak supervisor manager provide generic customer support number emailfrustrate check website againjust hour laterand suddenly price change time able rebook flight extra total entire experience make clear real criterion behind charge completely vague invisible customerslesson learn there s always hide price behind cheap option often come form stress frustration unexpected cost

"Do you want to be frustrated ? Then book with gotogate. Do you want to be cut off on their chat box ? Then book with gotogate. Do you want to repeatedly be asked the same questions by some not the use gotogate. Do you want them to dent having your booking even thought the airline has it then book with gotogate. Awful customer service. I booked a flight and mis spelt my surname and I asked them to change it a short while afterwards. They refused and said they can’t do it and said I would have to cancel the flight and pay them a fee and I would also have to pay British airways a fee. I contacted the airline who told me that only the booking agent can change the name and the only reason they want me to cancel is they can keep the taxes on the ticket. Then gotogate said they have no record of the booking but I have a screenshot of it and sent it to them. I am contacting the consumer protection agency to lodge a formal complaint. I suggest anyone who has problems with this company should do so as penalties or governance shall not be changed unless challenged. This is customer mis service that is being touted by this company. And before they reply saying they have not got my ref number it is M8LPD4. Earlier today they said they couldn’t find it but the airline has the booking. So if u want to throw money down the sink use gotogate. Fiona Quinn. As of today 04th February, I have still not heard back from gotogate as to what has happened to my booking and whether they have changed the spelling of my surname. There is no point replying on Trust pilot to say you hope I will use your service again. Why would I do that ? You have not sorted out the issue I have E mailed to your “customer service ‘ desk. If u want to genuinely help then sort it out. I have no faith in this company at all. Their apologies are worthless until they rectify the issue which they have not done. Save yourself the frustration and book with anyone that is not gotogate or affiliated to them. Update 12.02.25 Gotogate wants me to pay them 30 euros to change one letter in my surname and also pay 40 euros to them that they will give the airline to do the same thing.

Just the say script every time. After horrible communication from GotoGate, they told us they are waiting for the airline. They said they put a request in back in November. Well we found out this is a big fat lie. We actually contacted the airline direct and they said they have never heard from GotoGate about our flight until 1st February. The airline was very helpful but said unfortunately we have to deal with GotoGate as we booked through them. The airline told us the refunds have been approved but GotoGate is saying they are waiting to hear from the airline and will process the refund when they get it. Well they have got the refund but are NOT refunding it back to us. It sounds like GotoGate just wants to keep peoples money, not do what they say they will do and lie about it.

"I had an absolutely terrible experience with Gotogate, and I want to warn others to avoid this company at all costs. I booked a flight to Brazil, and one of the main reasons I chose Gotogate was the inclusion of a checked baggage allowance. However, without my consent, Gotogate unilaterally canceled my baggage, completely changing the terms of my purchase.When I contacted their customer service, they told me to resolve the issue with LATAM. After multiple attempts, LATAM confirmed that they were unable to add the baggage to my reservation because the error had occurred on Gotogate’s end.Gotogate’s only proposed solution was for me to bring my luggage to the airport on the day of my flight and attempt to purchase baggage at check-in. This is completely unacceptable and highly risky. Buying baggage at the last minute could result in:Excessively high fees compared to pre-booking rates.Limited baggage availability, meaning I could be denied the ability to check my luggage altogether.Unnecessary stress and uncertainty right before my flight.Delays or missed flights, if baggage issues take too long to resolve.Despite trying to resolve this issue amicably, Gotogate has refused to take responsibility or offer a solution. Under Australian Consumer Law (ACL), customers have the right to a full refund when a service does not match what was contracted. Gotogate’s actions are a clear violation of consumer rights, and I demand a full refund for this unacceptable situation.I have already contacted the ACCC (Australian Competition and Consumer Commission) and other consumer protection authorities.Save yourself the stress and money—DO NOT BOOK WITH GOTOGATE!",1,Negative,absolutely terrible experience gotogate want warn other avoid company cost book flight brazil one main reason choose gotogate inclusion check baggage allowance however without consent gotogate unilaterally cancel baggage completely change term purchasewhen contact customer service tell resolve issue latam multiple attempt latam confirm unable add baggage reservation error occur gotogate endgotogate propose solution bring luggage airport day flight attempt purchase baggage checkin completely unacceptable highly risky buying baggage last minute could result inexcessively high fee compare prebooke rateslimite baggage availability meaning could deny ability check luggage altogetherunnecessary stress uncertainty right flightdelay miss flight baggage issue take long resolvedespite try resolve issue amicably gotogate refuse take responsibility offer solution australian consumer law acl customer right full refund service match contract gotogate action clear violation consumer right demand full refund unacceptable situationi already contact accc australian competition consumer commission consumer protection authoritiessave stress moneydo book gotogate

"We booked internal flights in Vietnam using Go to Gate. Our flights were cancelled and rebooked by VietJet due to a Typhoon, which obviously cannot be helped. Our flight was pushed back 2 days, but we found flights a day earlier so booked them and cancelled our flight with VietJet as we were outside of the 48 hour cancellation window. There was no notification from Booking.com or Go to Gate on the change of flight. We only saw it once we tried to check in the day before the flight.I have been chasing my refund since October.

"Extremly poor customer service and very incompetent.

Second flight was dealed with Qatar Airways very fast but here is where things go south, while contacting customer support for both flights on the 4th of January they discover they have sent the first request to the wrong email address of the airline, meaning the request never made it anywhere. We were advised to wait the 15 business days, then when we contactewd them a couple of time the only thing that they send in the live chat is very long google translated CS templates that help no one and give no information. After we waited the 15 business days we were than advised to wait 1-2 more weeks, for what, they coudn't say. The customer service has no stopped replying to any messages and the company is obviosuly not wanting to proceed with refunding our flight which we will be taking legally if we don't hear from this company by mid week as all time lines mentioned in their terms and conditions have been breached, they have not returned our money and we can't process this with the ailine as they act as a travel agency.

"Beware Before Booking with This Vendor – Deceptive Practices!I booked 4 tickets through this vendor, thinking it would be straightforward and reasonably priced. Unfortunately, it turned into an absolute scam. Here’s what happened:	•	I paid $90 per seat during booking, thinking I was securing seating for everyone in my group. When I checked the airline’s website later, I discovered the same seats cost only $40!	•	I tried to add luggage to my booking for an extra $100 per person as initially offered. However, I couldn’t do it through this vendor’s platform, so I contacted their customer service. They redirected me to the airline directly. That’s when I learned the airline charged only $45 per person for luggage—a fraction of what this vendor suggested.	•	Out of curiosity, I searched the same exact flight, dates, and options directly with the airline. The total came out $435 cheaper than what this vendor charged me, and both seats and luggage were significantly cheaper on the airline’s website.When I reached out to the vendor for clarification, price matching, or any form of compensation, they offered no resolution. I wasn’t even able to cancel for a refund.This experience has been frustrating and deceptive. I will never book through this third-party vendor again.

"Gotogate ticket service provider are scammer. I had a terrible experience with GoToGate and would not recommend them to anyone. I purchased an economy ticket in June 2024, through their platform to travel on a WestJet flight, but they downgraded me to an ultra-basic ticket without my knowledge or consent. As a result, I was unable to travel with my carry-on luggage and had to pay an additional fee just to bring it on board. To make matters worse, I was among the last passengers allowed to board the plane.When I first noticed this issue, I contacted a GoToGate agent/ customer service immediately, but they gave me the runaround. I reached out over six times, and each time I was told to call back. I actually escalated the problem to a supervisor and still didn’t get any resolution. Despite all my efforts for several months the problem was never resolved. This experience was incredibly frustrating, and I regret booking through GoToGate. Save yourself the trouble and book directly with the airline or through a more reliable agency. It may appear that you will be saving money using them but they will scam you.I reviewed your response Gotogate and I am fully aware that this is only a generic response. After calling your company several times from September 2024 until December 14, 2024, I received the same reply from all of your agents. I was even asked to fill out a refund request form but the money I used to pay for my check bags was not returned. GOTOGATE ARE SCAMMERS!

Airline changed flight details. I accepted flight change - however by the time the go to gate team tried to execute change the seats were no longer available. Advised refund would be processed in 10-15 days. Nothing 7 calendar weeks later and no communication around delay. Contacted customer service team who advised they would not email airline again to follow up refund (wanting to give 2 days to respond) and further told me they wouldn't be able to update me on status and I had to contact them again. Terrible service. Will never use again.Additional- an example of poor service in the response to my complaint. No email has been received from them since the initial cancellation (9th December). I contacted the service team on 23rd Jan and was advised an email had been sent (perhaps from booking.com) to follow up on 21st Jan.

"My experience with Booking and GoToGate has been extremely disappointing. I booked a flight through their platform, and the airline made significant changes to the itinerary that completely disrupted my plans. Instead of offering an effective solution or a fair refund, both companies simply adhered to rigid policies that clearly favor the airline and not the customer.What’s worse is that they make it seem as if the customer is the one canceling the reservation, when in reality, the changes are the airline's responsibility. This is not only frustrating but also leaves the customer feeling completely helpless. Additionally, their customer service is slow and not focused on resolving real issues.I do not recommend using these platforms to book flights. It’s clear that customer interests are not their priority, and this experience has left a bad impression that I will share widely to prevent others from going through the same.I won’t be trusting these services again. If you’re looking for fair treatment and quick solutions, I strongly advise seeking other alternatives.Answer your comments: Thank you for your response. While I understand that schedule changes are initiated by the airline and not the agency, I must emphasize that my dissatisfaction stems from how this situation was handled by your platform.When I first sought a refund due to the substantial schedule change, I was informed that the cancellation would be considered voluntary, which is entirely untrue. The change in itinerary was beyond my control and directly affected my travel plans, forcing me to incur additional expenses, including extended accommodations and costs associated with a layover exceeding 24 hours.Additionally, despite the inconvenience caused, the refund for the extra baggage I purchased was not initially acknowledged. This demonstrates a lack of fairness and consideration for the customer.What adds to my frustration is that, as an intermediary platform that profits from customers using your services, you declined to represent my interests in resolving this issue with the airline. Your role as an agency should include advocating for customers when such disruptions occur, yet this responsibility was not fulfilled.I hope you take this feedback seriously and reconsider how these situations are managed in the future to ensure better support for your customers.",1,Negative,experience booking gotogate extremely disappointing book flight platform airline make significant change itinerary completely disrupt plan instead offer effective solution fair refund company simply adhere rigid policy clearly favor airline customerwhat bad make seem customer one cancel reservation reality change airline responsibility frustrating also leave customer feel completely helpless additionally customer service slow focused resolve real issuesi recommend use platform book flight clear customer interest priority experience leave bad impression share widely prevent other go samei will not trust service you re look fair treatment quick solution strongly advise seek alternativesansw comment thank response understand schedule change initiate airline agency must emphasize dissatisfaction stem situation handle platformwhen first seek refund due substantial schedule change inform cancellation would consider voluntary entirely untrue change itinerary beyond control directly affect travel plan force incur additional expense include extended accommodation cost associate layover exceed hoursadditionally despite inconvenience cause refund extra baggage purchase initially acknowledge demonstrate lack fairness consideration customerwhat add frustration intermediary platform profit customer use service decline represent interest resolve issue airline role agency include advocate customer disruption occur yet responsibility fulfilledi hope take feedback seriously reconsider situation manage future ensure well support customer

Therefore the refund link expired several days before I figured it out and was able to log in.  By that time it was too late and the refund link expired.All of this happened 6 months ago.  I immediately called Gotogate and after struggling with their insane voicemail system by some miracle got to a live agent.  They promised to resend the refund link.

Every time I reach out, there’s either no response or vague promises that lead nowhere.This experience has been a nightmare, and I would caution anyone against booking with Gotogate.

"This company is a complete and utter scam. I tried changing my flight after seeing a 1,400 price on their website for the desired date. But since they only let you contact them by chat or phone, I had to waste my time talking to multiple agents:First agent tried to charge me 8,000—not the 1,400 shown online.Second agent claimed the fare I wanted was suddenly “not available.”Third agent insisted there were no changes possible at all.Fourth agent finally found the date only to tell me the airline “gives an error.”What kind of sick joke is this? They’re blatantly bait-and-switching customers with a fake online price, and their support is an absolute nightmare. You spend hours chasing an advertised deal that magically disappears once you talk to a real person. This place is beyond terrible.save yourself the headache and stay far away.

"I had a terrible experience with Gotogate in July 2024. I booked a ticket for return to South Africa in 85 days. When I wanted to extend my return date by a month I was told that it was only a 90 day ticket and I had to fly on my return or throw that ticket in the dustbin. As a 75 year-old pensioner I did not want to simply throw away the ticket so I flew home but had to buy another FULL return ticket to Thailand where I am a VOLUNTEER english teacher. Gotogate just kept sending me to Etihad Airways who kept sending me back to Gotogate. How can they sell a 90-day only ticket without making it VERY plain that it is for 90 days only. I have never heard of such a thing before! So I bought a new ticket from South Africa and am back in Thailand but need to change the return date and have noticed, to my disgust, that I bought my new ticket through My.Trip.com who I see only now is the SAME company as Gotogate. God help me! I cannot get anyone to pick up the phone there att My.Trip.com, Qatar Airways refers me back to My.Trip.com.So I am back on the same boat of NO PROPER SERVICE! Gotogate and My.Yrip.com are completely useless in my opinion and I am sure the manager/owners are just laughing all the way to the bank. They hide behind BOTs too afraid to face the customers they have ripped off. They do not provide phone numbers. If you AI is barely functioning you need to allow easy human contact until your little BOT can do EVERYTHING on the app and not just give instructions to contact your chosen airline to change flight dates!",1,Negative,terrible experience gotogate july book ticket return south africa day want extend return date month tell day ticket fly return throw ticket dustbin yearold pensioner want simply throw away ticket fly home buy another full return ticket thailand volunteer english teacher gotogate keep send etihad airways keep send back gotogate sell day ticket without make plain day never hear thing buy new ticket south africa back thailand need change return date notice disgust buy new ticket mytripcom see company gotogate god help get anyone pick phone att mytripcom qatar airways refer back mytripcomso back boat proper service gotogate myyripcom completely useless opinion sure managerowner laugh way bank hide behind bot afraid face customer rip provide phone number ai barely function need allow easy human contact little bot everything app give instruction contact choose airline change flight date

Scammers. Avoid. Paid extra for a seat which due to “operational changes” I wasn’t allocated. When I got onto the plane someone else was sitting in the seat we had both paid for. They sell this “add on” with no attempt to actually book your seat and refuse to refund. I am charging back through my credit card and will never let anyone I know willing book through these sharks. They reply to every negative review with some nonsense. This is a genuine account of what happened. The only response from them should be a shameful apology and an immediate refund. As expected a total B/S answer not taking responsibility for taking my money and blaming the airline. No proof from them they actually booked the seat in my name. Interesting they call it my seat preference when I’ve paid £79 to reserve it. Not a preference.

"I had an extremely disappointing experience with Gotogate.com that I feel compelled to share. I purchased what was advertised as a 'flexible ticket' from London to Singapore. However, when I attempted to make a change to my booking, I was quoted £2,000 for the modification fee. This fee seems excessive and defeats the purpose of a flexible ticket option, especially considering that a new one-way ticket for my desired date was available through another carrier for only £700.The customer service experience was also problematic. The support team, while trying to assist, had significant communication difficulties which made resolving my issue more challenging. I spent considerable time trying to get clear answers about the high modification fee, but to no avail.Based on this experience, I cannot recommend booking through Gotogate.com. The 'flexible ticket' option appears to offer little actual flexibility given the extremely high modification costs, and I believe this should be made clearer to customers before purchase. I would strongly advise potential customers to carefully review all terms and conditions, particularly regarding ticket modifications, and to compare prices with direct bookings through airlines.",1,Negative,extremely disappointing experience gotogatecom feel compelled share purchase advertise flexible ticket london singapore however attempt make change booking quote modification fee fee seem excessive defeat purpose flexible ticket option especially consider new oneway ticket desire date available another carrier customer service experience also problematic support team try assist significant communication difficulty make resolve issue challenge spend considerable time try get clear answer high modification fee availbase experience recommend booking gotogatecom flexible ticket option appear offer little actual flexibility give extremely high modification cost believe make clear customer purchase would strongly advise potential customer carefully review term condition particularly regard ticket modification compare price direct booking airline

"I cannot express how deeply disappointed I am with Gotogate’s service. I booked flights with them to attend my mother’s funeral, only to face a series of unimaginable failures that left me stranded, emotionally distressed, and financially burdened.Gotogate sold us a trip that failed to provide the necessary printable boarding document for my connecting flights VietJet flights (VJ884 and VJ1626). As a result, I was denied entry at Mumbai Airport, and my husband and I were stranded for 24 hours without proper food, support, or any solutions offered. We were left helpless as time passed and alternative flights became fully booked.We eventually had to purchase expensive last-minute Vietnam Airlines tickets and an additional connecting flight from Kuala Lumpur to Danang. When the connecting flight was delayed, we had to abandon it, tripling our financial loss.Adding to my grief, I missed my mother’s funeral—a loss that is irreplaceable and has left me emotionally devastated. Despite all of this, Gotogate’s only response to my detailed complaint was a minimum refund without recompensation and redirection to phone or chat customer service, which I cannot emotionally bear to deal with after this ordeal.Gotogate’s negligence, lack of accountability, and complete disregard for their customers’ well-being are unacceptable.

It's January 2025 now and I'm flexible in rescheduling my flight to any other month, but they told me that from now (January) to December 2025 there is no available seat in the economy class, so I had to pay minimum 2344 euros to reschedule.

"I am writing this open letter to recount my recent experience with Gotoget, a company that has effectively scammed me out of USD 1,500. I feel compelled to share these details publicly to warn others and shed light on the company’s practices.Failure to Deliver on a Promised Phone CallAfter purchasing a flexible ticket, I contacted Gotoget on timefor a rebooking. They accepted and later told me rebooking and cancelling of the flexible ticket is not possible. I was shock of the sudden verbal change of policy.  When I complained further, they promised to investigate and get back to me. Despite repeated assurances that they would contact me by phone to confirm the details, I received no phone call and no assistance.Refusal to Rebook Despite “Flexible” TicketFrom the start, the ticket was flexible—meaning it should be both rebookable and refundable. Yet, Gotoget abruptly claimed that their “company policy” prohibits rebooking. This I feel someone is tryung to scam me here. This stance is not only unethical but also contradicts the very nature of a “flexible” ticket.Unjust Rejection of a Refund RequestSince Gotoget failed to facilitate the rebooking, I then requested a refund—a perfectly reasonable request given the ticket’s stated flexibility. Instead of honoring this, Gotoget issued a blanket refusal, offering no viable explanation and leaving me with a loss of USD 1,500.Documented Evidence of Their Initial AgreementI possess written documentation indicating that Gotoget initially acknowledged my right to a rebook. Their sudden reversal seems designed to keep my money, violating the trust any customer would have in a service provider.Legal and Ethical ImplicationsI take legal obligations and ethical standards very seriously. It is deeply concerning that Gotoget’s policies and practices appear to be in conflict with both consumer protection laws and basic fairness. I am fully prepared to pursue legal avenues if they continue to withhold my rightful refund.Warning to the PublicMy intent in making this statement is to alert others who might consider doing business with Gotoget. The deceptive use of the term “flexible ticket” and the subsequent refusal to rebook or refund is nothing short of scamming behavior.Gotoget has wrongfully retained USD 1,500 of my money by denying a rebook and refusing a refund. I urge this company to reverse its course immediately and uphold its contractual and ethical responsibilities.",1,Negative,write open letter recount recent experience gotoget company effectively scamme usd feel compel share detail publicly warn other shed light company practicesfailure deliver promise phone callafter purchasing flexible ticket contact gotoget timefor rebooking accept later tell rebooke cancel flexible ticket possible shock sudden verbal change policy complain promise investigate get back despite repeat assurance would contact phone confirm detail receive phone call assistancerefusal rebook despite flexible ticketfrom start ticket flexiblemeaning rebookable refundable yet gotoget abruptly claim company policy prohibit rebooke feel someone tryung scam stance unethical also contradict nature flexible ticketunjust rejection refund requestsince gotoget fail facilitate rebooke request refunda perfectly reasonable request give ticket state flexibility instead honor gotoget issue blanket refusal offer viable explanation leave loss usd document evidence initial agreementi possess write documentation indicate gotoget initially acknowledge right rebook sudden reversal seems design keep money violate trust customer would service providerlegal ethical implicationsi take legal obligation ethical standard seriously deeply concern gotoget policy practice appear conflict consumer protection law basic fairness fully prepare pursue legal avenue continue withhold rightful refundwarning publicmy intent make statement alert other might consider business gotoget deceptive use term flexible ticket subsequent refusal rebook refund nothing short scamming behaviorgotoget wrongfully retain usd money deny rebook refuse refund urge company reverse course immediately uphold contractual ethical responsibility

I went through the whole booking process on two flights with different airlines (I had looked at booking the two separately and there was no saving so I decided to keep it on one booking with GoToGate). After filling in all details of passengers and my card details it popped up an alert saying the flights had gone up by £50 and asked me to confirm that new price.I then closed the pop up and checked the flights separately again and there had been no change in price so I just booked them separately.

"Save Yourself the Stress—Do Not Book with Go to GatePlease save yourself the headache and avoid booking with Go to Gate. This has been the most outrageous booking experience I’ve ever had. If you need to rebook or change a flight, don’t expect any help from their customer service. They are completely unhelpful, indifferent, and outright dismissive.The customer service team is shockingly poor—lacking integrity, competence, and basic knowledge. My experience with Go to Gate was traumatic, to say the least. It felt like dealing with scammers rather than a legitimate travel agency.To the CEO, leaders, and anyone managing this agency: shame on you for how you run this business.

"I want to report a baggage scam by Gotogate in partnership with Booking.com.Shortly after booking my flight tickets to Shanghai, I received an email stating that Gotogate has failed to secure a check-in baggage for me due to a ""technical error"". I am forced to contact the airlines and buy the baggage at a very ridiculously exorbitant price. I end up paying 25% extra of the cost of my flight tickets just for a baggage. I think this is a scam by Gotogate. Basically they make people buy basic flight tickets with the false impression that it has checked-in baggage. They will later send an email saying how a ""system error"" has forced them to refund your baggage only. This will then force you to pay an incredibly high price just for a bag separate from tickets.

"I am reposting my review because gotogate ""commented"" or rather dismissed my first review because I did not include the optional booking code, insinuating perhaps that my review was not real. So, here is my updated review, with the booking code provided.I booked tickets for my family this morning and quickly realised I needed to change them. Within 30 minutes – before the airline had even issued the tickets – I called to cancel. The gotogate link to my booking still showed “booking reference not yet available.” Despite this, I was told by a cold and unyielding customer service agent that cancelling would cost me $180.I tried to reason with her, explaining the timing and the fact that no tickets had been issued yet. Her response? “I have to follow our policies.” There was no flexibility, no understanding – just rigid adherence to policies clearly designed to extract money from customers.To make matters worse, the airline itself offers free cancellations and changes within 24 hours of booking. Yet this website imposed fees for a service the airline provides for free.This company’s dismissal of my first review is yet another example of their lack of accountability and poor customer service. Despite providing detailed information (date, phone call, cancellation, and fee), they chose to brush it off with a “receipts or it didn’t happen” approach.This was my first and last time using this site. If you value fair treatment and reasonable policies, I suggest you look elsewhere.

"Never ever think of booking a plane ticket with GoToGate as they have the most useless customer support. After having mistyped one letter while booking a ticket, it's now been ten days that we have literally spent hours on the phone with them and the air company but GoToGate are unwilling to help us. We contacted them within minutes after having booked the tickets and at first, we paid the extra 50 euro fee to make the change. However, they refunded the money saying they cannot make the change as Luxair, the air company, doesn't allow them to do so. When calling Luxair, they weren't able to make the change either as the ticket was bought through GoToGate. Luxair wrote a note on their internal program clearly stating that the name should be changed and told they should be contacted again bt GTG. No matter how many time we called GTG afterwards, we always have the same answer ""we cannot make the change as Luxair doesn't allow us"". For god sake, how on earth isn't possible to delete a single letter on a booked ticket! Who has access to the system?Luxair cannot do it since we were stupid enough to buy a ticket on GTG, which now tells us to cancel the ticket and buy a new one. But we have two kids attached to the ticket, which means we are losing three tickets due to their incompetency.

"Stay away, book with a more responsible company or directly with the airline. Another online travel agency who is not customer friendly, charges fees not permitted by international rules and hides behind anonymity when you request to speak to a supervisor. We booked a ticket for my wife and daughter. There was a simple mistake in the name of one of the tickets. We called immediately and were told we would be charged 450 SEK to change the name or else could cancel. This was less than one hour after booking and by regulation you should be able to cancel for free within 24hours for international flights. We were then told that if we cancelled we would be charged 900 SEK.

"I purchased a ticket through Gotogate, and somehow—whether it was their mistake or the website’s glitch—‘Ms.’ was mistakenly entered instead of ‘Mr.’. I called their customer service, and instead of fixing it, they asked me to send my passport details, promising they’d make the update. I complied, thinking it would finally be resolved.Instead, they came back with a ridiculous response, saying I should check with the airline, as most airlines don’t care about titles. They essentially closed my ticket without making any real effort to fix it.Frustrated, I contacted the airline directly, but it took days for them to respond. When I finally got through, they told me titles are important, and that I’d need to go back to Gotogate to make the change.So, I called Gotogate again. A very annoyed customer service agent picked up, kept me on hold for ages, and finally came back to tell me I’d have to pay 110 AUD just to change the title. That includes both the airline’s fees and their service charge.My round-trip ticket from Nepal to Perth with a layover in Malaysia cost me 1500 AUD. Now they’re charging me over 110 AUD just to correct a simple mistake?I asked to escalate to a manager. Instead, they told me I’d have to wait for the manager to call me back—no timeframe given. It seems like they don’t even have the courtesy to transfer my call to someone who can actually help.This is such a ripoff. I paid 220 AUD for a ‘flexible ticket add-on,’ which I didn’t even realize had been added—money wasted on something that doesn’t seem to do anything at all other than empty my account.On top of that, they charge 110 AUD just to change my title. And I can’t even fix this directly with the airline because Gotogate has some shady contract with them, forcing me to pay this ridiculous fee just to get their commission.It’s clear—Gotogate is not here to help customers; they’re just here to rip people off. Absolutely infuriating.",1,Negative,purchase ticket gotogate somehowwhether mistake website glitchm mistakenly enter instead mr call customer service instead fix ask send passport detail promise they d make update comply thinking would finally resolvedinstead come back ridiculous response say check airline airline do not care title essentially closed ticket without make real effort fix itfrustrate contact airline directly take day respond finally get tell title important i d need go back gotogate make changeso call gotogate annoyed customer service agent pick keep hold age finally come back tell I d pay aud change title include airline fee service chargemy roundtrip ticket nepal perth layover malaysia cost aud they re charge aud correct simple mistakei ask escalate manager instead tell i d wait manager call backno timeframe give seem like do not even courtesy transfer call someone actually helpthis ripoff pay aud flexible ticket addon do not even realize addedmoney waste something do not seem anything empty accounton top charge aud change title can not even fix directly airline gotogate shady contract forcing pay ridiculous fee get commissionit cleargotogate help customer they re rip people absolutely infuriate

We have been waiting since July to get a refund on flights that were cancelled by the airline. It’s now January. When it happened we had to prove to them that the flight was canceled by directly contacting the airline ourselves and providing that to go to gate. Now everytime we call we’re told either “yep we’ll process that for you and you should receive it in the next 10 business days” or “we have escalated this case for you”. We still have not received a refund or an update and have to continually chase it up ourselves only to be lied to and given the same responses.We have since contacted the airline ourselves and they advised a full refund has been authorised and gave us a code to provide to go to gate. We called go to gate yet again and provided these details only to be told ‘we are still waiting on the airline’ despite us having evidence from the airline that everything has been approved and told to continue waiting as if we haven’t been out of pocket for 6 months.

GotoGate just had to contact that airline for this.According to GotoGate, however, this was absolutely not possible at Tuifly, even when I passed on that I had already checked with Tuifly myself and they were willing to make the adjustment after a simple phone call from Gotogate.The only option according to the customer service employee of GotoGate was to cancel the plane ticket with all additional costs.Total disproportionate and a scam.

"The wrost service I have ever had in 54 years. I bought a ticket using skyscanner and completed the purchase with GoToGate. That was a huge mistake. Due to unforeseen circumstances I need to change the dates of my flight.. I spoke to 4 or 5 different people and they always say I will receive a call next day to resolve the situation, or an em-mail with 2 hours but nothing they said happened. Then I have to call again, and again. It's very unhelpful and stressful. On Saturday 28/12/2024 I was told I had to pay £400 to change the dates. I paid and after 5 minutes I was told they cannot change the dates because LATAM did not accept your payment, and that it'll be refunded with 5 to 7 working days (let's see) and that I should call LATAM directly. I did. LATAM told me as I purchase the ticket with GoToGate, there is nothing they can do. I asked why they refused the payment, the LATAM girl chekced and said there is no record of any refused payment. Did the attendant lied? I was advised to contact GoToGate again, which I did and I was told I had to pay £264 to change the dates. I did again. And the guy said he could not change the dates. Twice the same issue, they say how much I should pay, I pay and they said they could not change the dates. I asked to speak to a manager but they are always in a meeting. I was old to call in 30 minutes, he wa trying to get rid of me. I was fuming, nearly crying of anger and frustration. I was told it has been escalated to another team and that I should wait few days.

"I don’t think I’ve ever written a review of a company before, and I would give them -5 stars if I could. I have been left with no choice but to let everyone know: please avoid GoToGate at all costs.I am absolutely appalled and disgusted by this company. I had a flight booked from Edinburgh to Melbourne, but unfortunately, I was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and had to undergo emergency surgery to remove a cancerous mass. Due to the risks, my doctors advised me not to fly at the time.I contacted Qatar Airways, who facilitated my flight, and they graciously agreed to honour my ticket until April 2025. This was a lifeline for me, as I live and work in Australia, and my family is there. However, when I later contacted Qatar to rebook my flight, I was devastated to learn that GoToGate had requested a refund on my behalf without my authorisation and made changes to my booking, preventing Qatar from honouring the agreement.When I asked Qatar for help, they informed me that only GoToGate has the authority to make changes to my booking since I made the reservation through them. Despite this, GoToGate has refused to take responsibility and continues to send me generic, unhelpful emails. For two months, I have been fighting to get this resolved, only to be told that they will offer me a meager refund of 300 AUD (minus a cancellation fee!) if I “accept.” This is clearly a tactic to absolve themselves of accountability.I feel completely lied to and utterly heartbroken. Even with everything I’ve been going through with ovarian cancer, they have shown no compassion or willingness to assist me.To make matters worse, after explaining my situation to a GoToGate team member, I was advised that I had called the wrong number. He then told me that I needed to “go in hard-on them and not give up.” If your own employees are advising you to take that approach, what does that say about the company?I cannot believe how negligent and dismissive this company is. Qatar Airways made it clear that GoToGate is the only party able to make changes to my booking, and yet they have completely abandoned me in this process.I am writing this review to warn others: please, please avoid GoToGate. I never thought something like this could happen to me, but it did. Don’t risk it.

"Worst experience ever! We are a family of 5 ( with 2 kids and a little baby 8 months) and we have booked a trip last minute from Male to Saigon (our previous flight was delayed due to cyclone and we couldn't catch the connected flight home). We lost our money from the first ticket as domestic flight Maldivian airlines is not connected with Air Asia.  So we decided to buy 5 new tickets with this Go to gate as it was showing as the short and affordable one with only stop over in Cochin India. MALE- COCHIN - HCMC ( half with INDIGO and the rest VIETJET) but no mention that different airlines and 7 hrs stopover you can't board unless with VISA to India.  So we were not allowed to board by the Airline officer of Indigo Airlines and we were stuck in Male on Xmas eve.  We were desperate ! Imagine with 8 months old baby with milk running out, at airport, No food and two other kids hungry and tired. A nightmare ! Go to gate disregards any  responsibility and say its the airline company that must inform, when we don't have contact with the airline when we buy the ticket. Nevertheless if you selling the ticket with this conditions there should be some information but there was none  whatsoever on this transfer that needs a visa if stopover in INDIA even if only stopover. Unbelieble. As we booked the previous day and  last minute we were not able of course to do visa. But the money they can receive but not inform. Let's see how long it is going to take to have it refund if ever. If not refunded we will definitely start a lawsuit procedure as although third party you must have accurate information. Booking, kayak and sky scanner should not be associated with this kind of lack of care and no service. NEVER EVER EVER AGAIN..,   Update Jan 6 2025 - Airline INDIGO sent me a reply saying that they have reimburse our flight but so far we have not received any refund.Update - I finally got info through the chatbot of gotogate that  INDIGO airline reimbursed 29 EUROS when we paid 2700 euros. As the gotogate also charges 44 euros commission of handling fees our reimbursement is O ... Is this even acceptable ???  Update in reply to answer of Gotogate - We did check the visa requirements. It says no need if you are only stopping over for a few hours. it should be mentioned on your site and when purchasing your tickets is that this does not apply when different airline companies are involved as you must collect the luggage and redo check in... It is Go to Gate responsibility to inform... I would have never have bought the ticket if I had known that we could not fly.... Update Jan 17 - almost after one month of the non travel event we have not yet been reimbursed of nothing. The go to gate says that they have received 29 euros out of 2700 euros of reimbursement and as they change 40 eur of commission we get zero.... How can this even be possible ? We were sold a ticket that it was not executable as last minute ticket for other then Indians is not possible to stop over in India...

"I booked a flight from TPE to MEL with Gotogate ""help"" and even paid for flexible tickets in case of some changes. I decided to save 30$ and didn't use the air company's website. Do not make this mistake. Gotogate might be good if everything goes smoothly. But in the cases like cancellation or any other changes - it will be a nightmare. It was the worst experience I had with the agent. My flight was cancelled and the air company changed my itinerary. Gotogate just said they cannot help ""due to the tool limitations"" (WTF?!) and I should deal with the air company by myself. I did it. Reasonably, the air company said you should go and ask the agent to deal with it. So I returned to Gotogate and they asked me to wait because ""We will escalate your cancellation request to our support team."" And I waited for almost a week with no answer. My flight is tomorrow and seems like I cannot return my tickets. Hope the story will end positively but I've already read reviews (pity, I didn't do it BEFORE the Gotogate booking was done). So, no big expectations about this. Just good luck to everyone else who uses Gotogate. Wish you won't book and just use another service.UPD. I contacted the support again - and they gave me the number to call for urgent needs +886255940484. And you know what? This number is not assigned to anyone, no response lol Nice ""service""UPD on 30/12/2024. My flight was gone and Gotogate in their reply mentioned it was my fault I didn't provide in my feedback my booking number but used my name and surname - seems like so many people with my name and surname are going from Taipei to Melbourne. Good to know. But if it's hard to find the number in your system, here it is: A35FKJ. But after you get it you will blame me it's already too late to do something. Sure, it was my fault I asked for help (and I paid for it as an additional service) 5 days before the flight.UPD on 07/01/2025.

Do not trust them. They are making 150% profits on adding luggage to your booking. Do not buy ANYTHING extra for them. Buy the extras directly from the airline. They are absolute crooks. I am a seasoned traveler yet I somehow managed to get fooled this time because i didn't go through my usual airline and chose an option I found from skyscanner instead.

"Disappointing Experience – Would Not Use AgainI had a frustrating and disappointing experience with GoToGate.co.uk and would not use them again, even if it worked in the end.Firstly, their website feels very outdated and cluttered. The chat feature is extremely difficult to locate, and even when you manage to find it, the service is incredibly slow. They take 10–15 minutes to reply, yet they disconnect you after being inactive for just 30 seconds. This lack of consistency adds unnecessary stress.The booking process is unnecessarily complicated. The site constantly bombards you with add-ons, and if you check one by mistake, you can’t move forward without confirming and paying for it. If you attempt to go back, the system forces you to restart the entire booking process from scratch.The site also repeatedly asks you to verify your email every single time you try to log in to check your booking. Even after verifying, it sometimes asks again, preventing you from accessing your booking details. This creates a very frustrating user experience.Making changes to flights is another ordeal. They impose high additional costs on top of the already expensive airline fees. Their support team is also unhelpful. They expect you to call them even if you’re abroad, but they lack an international helpline or local contact numbers for different countries. Email support is nonexistent, and the chat service is unreliable and shuts down quickly whenever it suits them.Overall, GoToGate.co.uk might have cheap flights, but the poor website functionality, hidden costs, and inadequate support make it an exhausting and stressful experience.

"Dear Gotogate,I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the experience I have had regarding my recent flight booking.After purchasing my ticket to Mozambique via your platform, I was informed that I would not be entitled to any refund if I decided to cancel. This left me with no other option but to request a rebooking. Initially, I was informed that the rebooking fee would be €42, but shortly after, I received a call stating that the amount was incorrect, and the actual fee was €184.To make matters worse, the system apparently could not update the rebooking for the return leg, meaning I had to pay €184 twice – once for the outbound flight and once for the return flight. This is incredibly frustrating, especially considering my original ticket cost €795.I also experienced significant inconvenience in trying to resolve this issue. I had to contact customer service multiple times, which involved lengthy wait times. Despite this effort, I was still charged exorbitant fees for rebooking and airport service charges.This entire situation has caused me unnecessary stress and financial strain. I kindly request that Gotogate review this matter and provide fair compensation for the inconvenience caused.I look forward to your response and resolution to this matter.Sincerely,Maria Tembe",1,Negative,dear gotogatei writing express dissatisfaction experience regard recent flight bookingafter purchasing ticket mozambique via platform inform would entitle refund decide cancel leave option request rebooke initially inform rebooking fee would shortly receive call state amount incorrect actual fee make matter bad system apparently could update rebooke return leg meaning pay twice outbound flight return flight incredibly frustrating especially consider original ticket cost also experience significant inconvenience try resolve issue contact customer service multiple time involve lengthy wait time despite effort still charge exorbitant fee rebooke airport service chargesthis entire situation cause unnecessary stress financial strain kindly request gotogate review matter provide fair compensation inconvenience causedi look forward response resolution mattersincerelymaria tembe

"Terrible Experience with Go to Gate – Refusal to Refund After Airline Changes My TicketI am extremely frustrated and disappointed with Go to Gate after they refused to refund my ticket, even though the airline confirmed that I am fully entitled to a full refund due to changes they made to my flight.Here’s what happened:1. The Airline Changes My Flight I originally booked a flight through Go to Gate, but the airline later made significant changes to my itinerary. They informed me that my flight had been altered, and they gave me the option to either accept the new flight or request a full refund. After reviewing the new schedule, I decided that the changes didn’t work for me, so I opted to request a full refund.2. The Airline Confirms I’m Entitled to a Refund After contacting the airline, they confirmed that, according to their policy, I was entitled to a full refund because the changes were made by them. They assured me that all I needed to do was reach out to Go to Gate to have them process the refund on my behalf. The airline also sent me written confirmation of this entitlement.3. Go to Gate Refuses to Process the Refund Despite the airline’s confirmation, Go to Gate has flatly refused to process my refund. Their customer service agents have been unhelpful, and they keep making excuses, claiming they need more time or that the airline hasn’t processed the refund yet—this, despite the airline telling me I am already entitled to it. It’s incredibly frustrating that they are not taking responsibility for this situation.4. Misleading and Conflicting Information Every time I contact Go to Gate, I get different answers. One representative tells me that the refund will be processed soon, and another tells me that it’s not possible. They have even claimed that my ticket wasn’t eligible for a refund, which contradicts what the airline has told me multiple times. It feels like Go to Gate is intentionally stalling or trying to avoid issuing the refund.5. Poor Customer Support and Communication The customer service has been beyond frustrating. I’ve waited for hours on the phone and sent numerous emails, but each time, the responses are vague or completely unhelpful. I’ve had to chase them down repeatedly, and they don’t seem interested in resolving my issue. There’s a complete lack of transparency and accountability, and I feel completely ignored.6. Unacceptable Delay and No Clear Resolution It has been weeks now, and I am still waiting for my refund. Go to Gate keeps pushing the issue back with no clear resolution. Meanwhile, I have confirmation from the airline that I should be getting a full refund. Go to Gate’s refusal to cooperate and process this is not only frustrating but completely unfair.Conclusion: I am beyond disappointed with Go to Gate’s service. They are refusing to process a refund that I am clearly entitled to, based on changes made by the airline. Their customer service is unresponsive, and the entire experience has been a complete nightmare.I would strongly advise others to avoid Go to Gate at all costs. I’ve been left in a difficult situation, and they are not willing to help in any meaningful way. I will not be booking with them again and will be sharing my experience with others to ensure no one else has to go through this. I’m now exploring other avenues to get my refund, but I shouldn’t have to be dealing with this in the first place.",1,Negative,terrible experience go gate refusal refund airline change ticketi extremely frustrated disappointed go gate refuse refund ticket even though airline confirm fully entitle full refund due change make flighthere happen airline change flight originally book flight go gate airline later make significant change itinerary inform flight altered give option either accept new flight request full refund review new schedule decide change do not work opt request full refund airline confirm I m entitle refund contact airline confirm accord policy entitle full refund change make assure need reach go gate process refund behalf airline also send write confirmation entitlement go gate refuse process refund despite airline confirmation go gate flatly refuse process refund customer service agent unhelpful keep make excuse claim need time airline have not process refund yetthis despite airline telling already entitle incredibly frustrating take responsibility situation mislead conflicting information every time contact go gate get different answer one representative tell refund process soon another tell possible even claim ticket be not eligible refund contradict airline tell multiple time feel like go gate intentionally stall try avoid issue refund poor customer support communication customer service beyond frustrating I ve wait hour phone send numerous email time response vague completely unhelpful I ve chase repeatedly do not seem interested resolving issue there s complete lack transparency accountability feel completely ignore unacceptable delay clear resolution week still wait refund go gate keep push issue back clear resolution meanwhile confirmation airline get full refund go gate refusal cooperate process frustrate completely unfairconclusion beyond disappointed go gate service refusing process refund clearly entitle base change make airline customer service unresponsive entire experience complete nightmarei would strongly advise other avoid go gate cost I ve leave difficult situation willing help meaningful way booking share experience other ensure one else go I m explore avenue get refund should not deal first place

I booked the flight on booking.com who are actually using Gotogate. I needed them to change the last name on the ticket after marriage and they simply can’t help.

After they already received the money from the airline company, they still would not refund me even with multiple live chats showing the email confirmations and conversations. After they confirmed that they received the funds from the airline AND I confirmed with all documentation, they then needed me to call to confirm again. I called and stayed on hold for 2 hours for them to tell me they would finally release my refunds. Then I get an email that they’re still charging me a $44 fee per person. I called back again and apparently there’s no managers to speak to. They never communicated this fee over the phone. How shady. Will never book with them again. This is a scam and such terrible customer service. Also there no way for you to reply back to their emails. They respond with a no reply email address. Ridiculous! And with their reply - no, when I called your rep told me I would be receiving a full refund and then sent me an email said she actually didn’t mention this charge, so this if a fault of your own staff.

"I had booked a flight earlier with a cancellation cover which would give me 90% of the ticket cost (i.e., 90% of the base rate for the flight, not the whole cost). I got it as a voucher, and whenever I try to apply the voucher, the system always increased the price of the ticket by saying ""the new price has increased by GBP X."" This increased price is always close to or over what the voucher covered, essentially nullifying the voucher. What is the point of us paying for the cancellation cover to get a refund on the ticket, and not be useful? Such a scam system. This happened at least 10 times, and I tried applying it with a different airline as well. Same response every time: ""the price just increased by GBP X."" They asked me to try booking a few hours later. No difference. They asked me to book through a different device. No difference. They asked me to clear the history, cookies and cache. No difference. I tried through a different browser, different person's laptop, different chrome profile. No difference. The only thing left for me to do is to not apply the voucher, and then see if the ""airline"" increases the cost. If it doesn't (when I don't apply the voucher code), it will be proof positive that GoToGate runs scams like these concealed inside a ""legit-looking"" business. The customer service is awful, and keep repeating the same thing again and again.

I am in utter shock and disbelief with how this company is able to still trade. I used them for my travel to Thailand and booked return flights through them. Within a week of me being there they told me the airline cancelled my flight home and they would need to rebook. I went through the process of rebooking through their online chat as I was anxious and worried that I would be left in Thailand with no way of getting home. I had to do this a further 3 times whilst I was away as the airline 'apparrently' kept cancelling my flights home. After the 3rd time I was cohearsed by their agent to take a full refund for the inconvenience 6 days before I was meant to fly home. They told me it would take 6-14 days for the refund to be processed back to my account and promised me this was a priority and matter of urgency due to the circumstances as I told them I would not be able to afford a flight home untill this is re-imbursed. It is now 23 days since the refund request was made and I have not received any further updates. I have now spent a whole week sleeping rough on the streets of Thailand with no money for food and everytime I contact them they give me the same generic crap that they seem to be telling everyone else that they have scammed. I paid through these guys for the service and due to my circumstances I am afraid I will die out here and they couldn't give a toss. They are happy to take the money but not refund or even offer some form of compensation so I can have a roof over my head and feed myself whilst I am here with no money due to their incompetence and lack of empathy or care for the customers they have stolen money from.

The worst experience EVER!Clearly all this bad reviews did not come from no where. If you are checking here before you book please what ever money your saving by booking with them is not worth it at all!! I have booked with other agents no issue but this company is the worst experience I’ve ever had. I probably spoke with at least 4 different agents from the back and forth calls they had me go through with the airline for a simple name change and everyone of the people I spoke with were no help or willing to help in any sort. This company also operates under Flight Network name so keep a look out for that. I ended up paying 137$ just to cancel my reservation and rebook because they were in willing to assist with my issue.

"I booked a flight through Booking.com, which unfortunately collaborates with Gotogate, a company I now consider nothing short of a scam. Everything seemed fine initially, but then the airline canceled my flight. Gotogate informed me that they had rebooked me on an earlier flight, which I could have chosen from the beginning if it suited my schedule (it didn’t).Since this was a European airline and the flight was within Europe, I contacted Gotogate to request a rescheduling to a later flight. Their response? They could only do it for a fee—despite the fact that the original cancellation was entirely beyond my control.When I asked for a refund, I was told I would only get half of what I paid, as they deemed it a “voluntary cancellation.” I explained that under EU regulations (EU261), this isn’t how it works. The clueless call center agent insisted this was my only option, adding insult to injury by lying to me, claiming:	•	The flight was merely “rescheduled” (it wasn’t—it was a different flight altogether).	•	The airline has a policy allowing them to act as they please if delays are less than 5 hours (utter nonsense).Clearly, their India-based call center staff is either uninformed or deliberately deceitful, as they seem to have no knowledge of EU passenger rights.In the end, I bypassed Gotogate entirely and called the airline directly. The airline resolved the issue in accordance with EU regulations, proving once again that Gotogate is completely useless.This was my first and last time using Gotogate. My advice? Stay far away from this company.

I have been trying to book a flight with them but each time I click 'pay' they increase the flight by ~£200!  I'm asked if I accept the additional cost before paying.

"""My experience with this company was absolutely disastrous, and I strongly urge anyone considering dealing with them to think twice. The company operates under multiple names, lacks transparency, and their customer service—based in India—only makes things worse instead of solving problems. After deducting the payment, they neither confirmed my booking nor sent the ticket, and every time I contacted them, I received the same unprofessional and frustrating excuses, claiming the airline hadn't confirmed the booking.When I directly asked them to either confirm the booking or refund my money, they kept stalling without giving a clear resolution, even though my travel date was fast approaching. To make matters worse, they warned me not to book another ticket on my own because they wouldn’t refund my money if I did so, leaving me in a very difficult position. As a result, I am now forced to pay a much higher amount to book a last-minute ticket due to their complete failure to confirm my trip.Dealing with this company is not just a waste of money but also an exhausting drain on time, effort, and patience. I strongly advise everyone to avoid them at all costs—they have no respect for their customers and provide absolutely no reliable service.

"I bought 4 flights with Swissair through Gotogate, so I could take advantage of their ‘Flexible’ ticket option. Gotogate advertise the service as follows:“A Flexible (rebookable) Ticket allows you to change your flight tickets no matter what the airline's rules are. If the price of the new ticket is higher you only pay the difference.”When I went to change my booking, for flights that were cheaper than the original booking. I was told I would have to pay an additional £360. I was told this was because the airline only makes certain tickets available for rebooking, and that they charge a different price to those available to the public online. I was later told that in fact Gotogate don’t know the policies of each the airlines and so take the reservation and sort out any issues later. And it turns out this airline doesn’t allow changes to bookings, so they would have to charge the airline fees. So they knowingly marketed a service they know they may not be able to provide. I was in total dismay at being told to “read the T&C’s” even though they had not read the policies of the airlines they work with. When selling the Flexible service, they clearly state they will not charge any fees, neither their own nor airline fees. I should not have to read the T&C’s to find out that the service they were selling me was never actually available.",1,Negative,buy flight swissair gotogate could take advantage flexible ticket option gotogate advertise service followsa flexible rebookable ticket allow change flight ticket matter airline rules price new ticket high pay differencewhen go change book flight cheap original booking tell would pay additional tell airline make certain ticket available rebooke charge different price available public online later tell fact gotogate do not know policy airline take reservation sort issue later turn airline do not allow change booking would charge airline fee knowingly market service know may able provide total dismay tell read tcs even though read policy airline work sell flexible service clearly state charge fee neither airline fee read tcs find service sell never actually available

"If you are pregnant or have specific medical needs requiring a MEDIF form for your flight, do not purchase tickets through GoToGate. This platform provided me with one of the worst experiences I've ever had.I booked my tickets for a LOT airline flight through GoToGate and needed to add a MEDIF form to my reservation. Over two days (21.11.2024 and 22.11.2024), I was tossed back and forth between LOT Airlines and GoToGate, neither taking responsibility for processing my request. GoToGate claims on their website to assist with adding MEDIF forms for customers flying with non-low-cost airlines (which LOT clearly is), but this promise turned out to be empty.LOT Airlines informed me that since my ticket was purchased through a travel agent, it was GoToGate's responsibility to add the MEDIF form. However, GoToGate's support team completely failed to assist me. They wasted 48 hours of my time, causing immense stress and sleepless nights, all while avoiding their obligations. Instead of resolving my simple request—to add a MEDIF form in accordance with LOT's policies—they simply told me to go to the airport with my documents, as they ""couldn't"" process the form.The customer service team offered no genuine help. They Googled irrelevant information, redirected me back to LOT, and clearly wanted to get rid of me. Their refusal to handle this straightforward request left me to deal with everything on my own, despite being pregnant and needing proper assistance.This ordeal caused me unnecessary stress and completely ruined my peace of mind. GoToGate failed in every aspect of customer service and showed no empathy or willingness to help a pregnant woman.

The absolute worst customer service on Earth!!! Firstly I was given the advice by them to book my flights without baggage & to call after to add the baggage. I did this then called back to be told I can only add it with the airline who were going to charge £179 per bag per leg rather than the £20:80 it should have been. I have been on the phone almost every day for 2 months to get this sorted & still no joy. The agents on the phone can't solve anything nor can they transfer my call to a manager.

"I would give zero stars if possible. My upfront advice is to spend a few extra dollars and book directly with the airline - this company is not worth the struggle and ended up costing me $600. UPDATE: Update on my experience with GotoGate:After hours of messaging their support team, GotoGate refused to take accountability for the issue they caused with my booking. They offered only generic apologies, shifted responsibility to the airline, and insisted on unattainable documentation. Despite my demands, they refused to provide direct contact with a manager and vaguely promised a call from their internal team within 24–48 hours.24 hours later, I received an email essentially stating they couldn’t help me. The email provided no further contact information, and it came from an address that doesn’t accept responses—yet another dead end in this frustrating process.Adding insult to injury, their public response to my initial review claimed they couldn’t address the issue because I hadn’t shared my order number—ignoring the fact that they already have all my information from our prior interactions.GotoGate’s behavior is emblematic of a company that prioritizes deflection and dead ends over resolution. Avoid them at all costs.Essentially, I booked a $600 flight with GotoGate, and had two legs of this flight that involved two different airlines. I am a frequent traveler, and can navigate myself exceptionally through all all the perils travel brings. About a week before my flight with GotoGate, I realized that my last name hadn’t made it on the second leg of my itinerary. I don’t know whose error this was, but it didn’t matter, as I knew to just call the airline to do a name edit. Both of the airlines that I called told me they were unable to edit my reservation because it was booked with GotoGate, and that I would need to contact them directly. Essentially, had I just booked with the airline it would have been an easy fix, but because GotoGate was involved, I had to go through them. Which was a nightmare. The only advice I received was “call the airline”, and when I explained I had called the airline, they just told me there was nothing they could do and I had to call the airline. I spoke to managers and multiple agents, and everyone told me there was nothing they could do. One agent told me it would take days to get the airlines approval to add my last name, so I wasn’t even worth it. One agent told me they could change two letters on my booking but not my whole last name. One agent said to email a copy of my passport and they would rush the request through to the airline to get the name edited. I did this, and the next day received an email saying they couldn’t change my name and I had to call the airline. With my departure date approaching, and not having any help or assistance, I was forced to buy an entirely new ticket on a different airline in order to make my trip. That ticket was $1200. When I called to demand a refund, or flight credit for the ticket I wasn’t able to use, they told me nothing could be done because “I had been instructed to contact the airline, via email”.

"Gotogate took my money and left me stranded in Bangkok. I booked a cheap round trip flight using gotogate, clearly the first mistake, you get what you pay for. I needed to leave sooner than I expected so I contacted them to try to change the dates. It would have cost more than the full trip itself to change the dates and they told me it would also cost more to cancel than I would get in return for a refund. Instead, as the agent suggested, I booked a different one-way flight which cost less than the cost to change the dates. I went on my trip, arrived earlier than I would have and then heard nothing from gotogate. The App still showed that I had a return ticket and still notified me that I needed to get to the airport. When I arrived, I was informed by the airline staff that I did not have a ticket. They told me to contact my ""agent"". I talked to the chatbot of gotogate until I could get to a live agent. They told me that the flight was confirmed in their system and to go back to the airline to check in. The airline told me it was still not confirmed and told me to contact the airline directly. When I called them they told me no changes were possible other than booking a new flight and paying the cancellation fee. Gotogate was no help. They gave me no notice that this was the airline's policy and advised me to take this course where I ultimately had to book a same-day flight with another airline. They said they would contact me about the situation, but still have not reached out.

"I booked flights to Tokyo via booking.com that were cancelled yesterday. those were even flex tickets, an option I paid extra. Now that the flight has been cancelled, the only option they are offering is a refund, no new flight, nothing. This is totally unacceptable because if I take the refund, I have to pay double the price for flights now because it's only 1,5 weeks before the start of the journey. What makes it even worse is that approx. 1.500€ will be missing from my travel budget that I was planning to spend there which puts me in a tight spot. even worse because apparently I can't even expect the money from the refund in the next couple of days but rather after I have come back after the journey. it#s awful and it's ruining my entire trip and they do absolutely nothing. for two days I've been trying to get an alternative but they claim the flight agency is not responding which is not true because I called Japan Airlines and they told me they sent waiver codes to gotogate yesterday, so they can rebook the flights. just seems like gotogate doesn't want to use them because it's too much work for them?

"Worst service and customer care is…Worst service and customer care is non-supportive.At the airport, the airline instructed me to contact them for further assistance.

Despite multiple requests, Gotogate has failed to provide proof of communication with the Airline and now even not replying to my mail.In addition, Gotogate has deducted service charges per passenger for the refund service, and I am dissatisfied with the service received.It appears the problem lies with Gotogate's reluctance to communicate effectively with the airline.I will not recommend anyone to Gotogate.Date of experience: September 12, 2024",1,Negative,bad service customer care isworst service customer care nonsupportiveat airport airline instruct contact assistance however speak representative long wait unable provide alternativesthe core issue overlook airline deny we boarding base mandatory requirement mention booking process ticket refund provide portal equitable flight cancellation fault despite multiple request gotogate failed provide proof communication airline even reply mailin addition gotogate deduct service charge per passenger refund service dissatisfied service receivedit appear problem lie gotogate reluctance communicate effectively airlinei recommend anyone gotogatedate experience september

"We booked a flight in august for a trip in december on booking.com. Somehow we got redirected to gotogate without then even asking for our permission! The ticket was overpriced, but as we havent seen the family for 5 years we were ready to pay more. 1 month ago came the first change. Layover increased by 2 hours. One week ago another change: part of the return flight canceled. The alternative option they gave us include two over nights stays in 2 diffrent cities, totalling 3 days on travel instead of one! And this for a family with a young kid…they also offered a refund part of it (insurance excluded). However knowing their reputation i doubt that they will pay back. Furthermore, receiving this information so short notive we woul neither get refunded our hotel. So we are stuck. They act as an intermediary which allows them to to not having to comply with the international Airlines Convention. Result: they wont pay the overnights which they would have to do under the convention. They neither comly with giving an reasonable alternative. I checked with the  directly who informed me about all alternative options. However, they would not want to change to a better ittinerary as we booked through gotogate. We actually lost all our rights! On the other hand Gotogate keeps deresponsabilizing themselves blaiming the airline. Thr actuallly just want us to cancel to sell the same ticket to a higher price.

I concur 100% with most of the posts here. Recent weather cancellation by Loganair booked through gotogate was not reimbursed in Oct and I am still on the back and forth with them.If I had booked directly with Loganair I would have my money back for the flight that was never flown.I would not recommend gotogate to anyone for booking ease and especially when issues arise. This should be the basics of the 3rd party groups business model to provide a service that is worth it to their customers and to help when you need help.No one wants to pay a third party for a lot of run around.

Updated: Order 1010-462-201 (Name: Singh)These guys are scammers! avoid at any cost. We had a return flight booked via Ethiopian airlines months ago and it seems the return flight was cancelled. The airline says that full refund is available if alternate dates not suitable and it is only possible via GotoGate as they were the agents. We have chatting and calling with these scammers for weeks if not months but they refuse to refund the full amount and we requested to speak with manager many times but never received a call. We spoke with a scammer by the name 'Vikas' today and again they are not willing too help and says that they will charge $400/ ticket and additional service costs charged by Gotogate and the supervisor has still not called. We spoke with Ethiopian air just now and they say that the Gotogate messed this up and we should be getting a full refund. Anyway we can officially file a complaint against these cheaters.

Didn’t have a good experience with them. They’re system for contacting them is very flawed and you can only live chat or call. Which took a lot of time and attention on my holiday when I had to try 5 times over multiple attempts to get the answers I was after.They also changed my flight (potentially the airlines fault) so that I had a 12 hour layover in Sydney rather than a 3. They also didn’t inform me that that meant I needed a visa for Australian transit (if there over 8 hours) which I had to then stressfully sort at check in and pay $20 for. The only thing I like is the easy to use app they have and the people I eventually talked to on the chat function were nice. Would seriously reconsider before ever using them again.,2,Negative,do not good experience they re system contact flawed live chat call take lot time attention holiday try time multiple attempt get answer afterthey also change flight potentially airline fault hour layover sydney rather also do not inform mean need visa australian transit hour stressfully sort check pay thing like easy use app people eventually talk chat function nice would seriously reconsider ever use

"GotoGate (through Booking.com) have been highly unprofessional and unethical in resolving my genuine request for a refund. It is now three months on and I am still battling a legitimate request for a refund for a Qantas flight I booked through booking.com, aka GotoGate. The OS flight in July was completely cancelled by the airline after a 48 hours delay, with customers told at 1:30am to make own arrangements to get home (stressful already). Being ping-ponged between booking.com and GotoGate (QANTAS gets its own 1 star review!) I was told in Sep by GtoG I would not be refunded without further explanation. After another dozen phone calls on numbers I had to dig up on their website, emails to addresses provided by the sales assistants that bounced (and one reply written in German) and promises my case has been escalated, I am still waiting; out of pocket for the new flight I had to book to get home, the original flight AND interest on my credit card for three months! I will take further action if I get knocked back again. This has been unnecessarily stressful, financially difficult and time wasting. Although some of the sales reps have been polite and empathetic, they do not provide any names of people or contacts to deal directly with one rep. I will avoid using GotoGate and Booking.com for any flights in future and never recommend to anyone.

This is the worst booking site for flights. They will not help you when airline changes flights. Their customer service only tells predefined answers. I have reached out to them about 5 time with no help whatsoever. Furthermore they are the partner when you book a flight in booking.com. So you should never book a flight through them.,1,Negative,bad book site flight help airline change flight customer service tell predefine answer reach time help whatsoever furthermore partner book flight bookingcom never book flight

"We had an extremely disappointing experience with Go to Gate. If any issues arise, they refuse to take responsibility—even when the fault clearly lies with them. They cancelled our flights without notifying us or obtaining our consent. When we reached out, they simply blamed the airline, despite the fact that the flights were still available to book (at a much higher price than our original purchase two months prior). Their lack of accountability and poor customer service make them an unreliable choice.

Gotogate’s customer service was unhelpful, slow, and seemed more interested in avoiding responsibility than providing solutions.After multiple attempts to reach customer support, I was given conflicting information and was left on hold for unreasonable amounts of time. Every time I finally got through, I was either redirected to another agent or told that they couldn't help. Booking.com should not be working with Gotogate if they are unable to provide even basic assistance.Overall, the experience was frustrating, stressful, and left me feeling stranded with no real support.

"Do not book with GotoGate, they are scammers.  I purchased a comfort flex ticket with Pegasus but when I received my ticket, it turned out to be the cheapest one which doesn't even allow checkin baggage.  I paid almost £80 extra for the comfort flex option, which was supposed to include 20kg check in, 8kg cabin and a small bag.  It should have also included free changes and onboard food, all of which I didn't get.  After spending a week calling GotoGate, I just kept getting told someone will contact me, but obviously nobody did.  Eventually, when it came to checking in, I upgraded myself paying extra to check in my luggage.  I was told I can claim this back from GotoGate, and after trying for the last few weeks, they are just fobbing me off again, and have now closed my complaint with no resolution.  I wish I read the other reviews before using Booking.com or GotoGate.  Apparently they do this sort of thing all the time!Update:  Thanks for your response, but If you genuinely care, you can start by replying to me and giving me the refund you promised on the phone.  You have my details as you have been emailing me with generic responses.  As far as I'm concerned, the case is still open and I will be pursuing with the regulators until a full refund is given.

Skyscanner please detach yourselves from Gotogate . A fraud and dodgy website. Trying to find their contact is hard and they don’t provide it on their FAQs. I paid for my fare only to find out 3 days before my flight that my “Extra Baggage” I paid for is my one 30kg baggage allowance which usually is automatically paid while you pay for your fare (I made sure I wasn’t paying the “travel lite” fare)  . So now I have only 1x 30kg baggage and 1x 7kg baggage. I have to pay another $115AUD to buy another bag. Altogether $330AUD for 2x checked bag and 1x 7kg carry on. What an absolute joke .

"I had a flight booked through Gotogate in March 2020 which had to be cancelled because of the pandemic. I was unable to rebook the flight within a year because of the ongoing pandemic, and Air Canada therefore refunded the fare - almost £400 - to Gotogate in March 2021 (as Air Canada confirmed to me on the phone). Despite my repeated calls and emails after that, Gotogate have never returned the money to me. Their 'customer care' is useless on the phone, and a brick wall by email. I have now tried a Subject Access Request to see their internal communications about the order, to be told by the parent company that they cannot access information from more than three years ago. I will never use them again, and recommend that no one else does either.Reply added after Gotogate's response: there seemed no point adding the booking code since, after extensive correspondence about my Subject Access Review, your parent company informed me that all information dating back more than three years had been 'obfuscated' and so couldn't be accessed. However, if that's not true, then the order code is L3C5P5, passenger name Ken Babstock (my husband), though I paid for the flight, a fact which you've repeatedly used to avoid talking to either of us. You have details for both of us, and a refund to either of us would always have been fine. I look forward to your response.Further edit: order code above, booking reference U9IN3A.

"Order 1021-786-035“Gotogate is, without question, the most dishonest, unreliable travel agency I’ve ever dealt with. Despite the airline confirming my refund was processed on October 6, Gotogate has outright refused to return my money. Their so-called ‘customer service’ is a joke—agents are evasive, unhelpful, and make empty promises to ‘look into it’ without any follow-up. It feels like they’re holding onto my money without any intention of refunding it, and they’re blaming everyone but themselves.This experience has been beyond frustrating; it’s been infuriating.

"Day 1 of leaving a bad review related to their company Gotogate: horrible service, empty promises. ultimate SCAM. Customer service we have spoken to: ADITYA, VALENTINA and SIMRAM. We have spoken to more but did not take note of the names then. We called in multiple times regarding name change for our flight ticket and the customer service all told us it is possible. We then made payment for this change and the gotogate website accepted it. However it has been at least 2 days and there is no change being made so we called in to check. To which, now the customer helpline operator is saying it is not possible to change. Isn’t this ridiculous? How could payment be accepted if it couldn’t be done? And could the customer helpline people be giving us all this false information? Now we want to speak escalate this and we are yet met with the “we will get back to you in 24 hours response” even after sharing that our flight is in about 36 hours. Utterly unprofessional and ridiculous. To add on everytime we call back to escalate issues the customer “helpline” says they will get back to us within 24 hours. Ofcourse, nobody has ever gotten back to us.  What kind of service is this? Just awhile ago Simram told us she has reached out to a manager and someone will be in contact with us as soon as we hung up. Afterwhich, we waited another 25 minutes and nobody called us. Another instance of being fed lies. So we had to waste our time and call in again and explain the whole situation for at least the 8th time.  This time, aditya, a male customer service personnel picked up. This was an unprofessional experience for 2 Main reasons.1. He constantly spoke over us and completely lacked professionalism and a sense of urgency. We repeatedly reminded him it was already midnight at our time and he told us to wait for the next few hours, even though someone previously said they’ll be calling us in the next 10 minutes 2. He gave us false information. He told us he has given our information to “the supervisor” to call us back “as soon as possible”. However when I asked who this supervisor was he was unable to respond. After trying to beat about the bush a few times he changed his stance and said there was actually no identified supervisor. Only the next available one will be contacting us. What does this mean? Was information even passed on to anyone or just left in the notes again?  This isn’t even everything horrible that has happened. I hope someone from the team will reach out to us soon.UPDate DAY 2 of leaving a bad review since I have to wait another 12 hours before I can leave my next review:Yet another big fat lie from the Gotogate team. Once again, NOBODY has gotten back to us. ADIYTA assured that the manager will call us back in the next few hours from midnight yesterday. It has been 26 hours since the last call and nobody has gotten back to us. Instead all I get is a reply on this review, saying they can’t do anything since I have not shared my order number on this platform. How can an agent say that? How can they expect me to post my order/confirmation number publicly? Another example of this company’s severe unprofessionalism. Today we had to call in today and GARGI picked up. She was very unhelpful. She was terrible. 1. To start, She ENDED the call on us.even after we said do not disconnect the call. What nonsense is this? You call this a helpline? 2. GARGI was lying to us. There were SEVERAL inconsistencies in what she was sharing. One moment she said the supervisor will call back 2-3 hours. Next moment she said 1/2/3/4 hours. Another instance: she tells us she has a supervisor and he is handling the case. We ask who is that and she can’t answer. Next moment she says supervisor is not assigned yet and we need to wait.  How can we have any assurance with her words always changing? This is just 2 of the instances of her lying to us. 3. GARGI was  VERY UNEMPATHETIC about our situation. we already shared we have been waiting for more than 24 hours and she says “have patience”. She constantly told us she can’t do this or that - basically unable to help us except telling us “have more patience or “wait for few hours when our flight is TOMORROW. She failed to understand the urgency of the issue. This is not even the entire horrible experience we had with GARGI from GOTOGATE.

"Horrible horrible company to book tickets with. Avoid them. Pay few pounds extra n book direct or anywhere else. We bought tickets from them 8 months ahead of our holiday, only to be told three days before flight that flight has been changed n we don’t have return tickets.

Called the agents to tell them that the airline is waiting for their email n gotogate reassured us that they emailed n all will be sorted , the airline never got any email n 12 hours before flight go to gate comes back saying no tickets available. They made us wait for 3 days. We resolved only by requesting airline to take ownership n they did n got us return tickets. Gotogate staff is very unprofessional, they lie, lure u by saying they will do their best n call back - they don’t. Don’t fall for their sweet talk as that’s only thing they have. Worst experience ever with gotogate.  We booked through booking.com n they had partnered with go to gate. Will be contacting booking.com regarding the poor service.Where to provide booking reference number so it can be looked up?

Have called them three times over past two weeks to be told it has been escalated and that i have to wait for someone to call me...they never call.

"Booked 8 tickets to majorca, including 8 checked (golf) bags and was given total price, which I paid. Then, hours later, had an email from GoToGate (which I would NEVER have used as they are awful) saying the booking had been made via them and they were refunding my checked baggage payment. They said both; there was a technical glitch and then later, the additional luggage request was refused by the airline. This was after I had paid. I would never have proceeded with this purchase if baggage had not been included in price. Customer service was terrible and no help whatsoever. So now have to try to arrange all of this myself with absolutely no help from Booking.com. I am Tier 3 Rewards customer for many, many years - I expected more from them.Have been in touch with Gotogate; they now say they have lost my booking reference and I cannot access my flight details.

"I booked a ticket from Amsterdam to Antalya via Istanbul. Return flight was also from Antalya to Amsterdam via Istanbul. Ajet changed the flight data and made it impossible to fly back home to Amsterdam. Gotogate informed me that they would request another flight on the next day, because flights on the day of the original return flight were all booked. That meant that I would lose a day of work on the next day, but I am not a difficult person. I thanked them for the effort and accepted the return flight on the next day. A week passed and I did not get any confirmation for my new return flight. I contacted Gotogate several times and they said they were still working on it and referred me back to Ajet. I contacted Ajet and they told me they can't do anything for me and referred me back to Gotogate. I contacted Gotogate and requested a refund so I could book another flight. They said they can't do refunds and referred me back to Ajet. I called Ajet and they said they can't do refunds for agency tickets. I understand operational changes can happen, but Gotogate is responsible for offering an alternative for the paying customer. And I also understand it takes time to book another flight, but if it takes Gotogate more than a week to rebook my flight, they are not good at their job. They kept telling me they haven't heard back from Ajet yet, but I spoke to Ajet several times on the phone. And I am not a superhero. I don't have magic fingers to dial a secret phone number to reach Ajet, so Gotogate can also contact them. Unfortunately, they have let me down and failed to provide the service I paid for. My flight leaves tomorrow and I have to pay double now because of Gotogate. Update: on the day of the flight I contacted Gotogate again asked them about the status of the change and they told the deadline for changes as passed and we cannot do anything for you anymore. On top of that they said I don't get a refund. I told them they requested the change longer than a week ago and I contacted them every day to acquire the status of the change. All they had to say was wait for confirmation and on the last day it was too late and I had to act sooner? Really????....Final Update: Please take note that the response of Gotogate was generic and even though I added a booking number they declined to give a content-related reply. Again, the airline changed the flight data and made it impossible to fly back home. Even though I requested a rebooking 8 days before the return flight, Gotogate did nothing to secure the tickets I paid for. If everything goes well Gotogate is a hero, but if problems arise outside of the customers fault, they refuse to help. Luckily my credit card company is more than willing to confront Gotogate with their handling of the situation. The payment will be blocked and Gotogate will have to answer for their incompetence in this matter.",1,Negative,book ticket amsterdam antalya via istanbul return flight also antalya amsterdam via istanbul ajet change flight datum make impossible fly back home amsterdam gotogate inform would request another flight next day flight day original return flight book mean would lose day work next day difficult person thank effort accept return flight next day week pass get confirmation new return flight contact gotogate several time say still work refer back ajet contact ajet tell can not anything refer back gotogate contact gotogate request refund could book another flight say can not refund refer back ajet call ajet say can not refund agency ticket understand operational change happen gotogate responsible offering alternative pay customer also understand take time book another flight take gotogate week rebook flight good job keep tell have not hear back ajet yet speak ajet several time phone superhero do not magic finger dial secret phone number reach ajet gotogate also contact unfortunately let fail provide service pay flight leave tomorrow pay double gotogate update day flight contact gotogate ask status change tell deadline change pass anything anymore top say do not get refund tell request change long week ago contact every day acquire status change say wait confirmation last day late act soon reallyfinal update please take note response gotogate generic even though add booking number decline give contentrelate reply airline change flight datum make impossible fly back home even though request rebooke day return flight gotogate nothing secure ticket pay everything go well gotogate hero problem arise outside customer fault refuse help luckily credit card company willing confront gotogate handling situation payment block gotogate answer incompetence matter

"I had a profoundly disappointing experience with GoToGate. My family and I booked flights from Erbil to London with a layover in Istanbul through GoToGate for August 13, 2024. Due to scheduling issues, we were informed that the first leg of our flight (Erbil to Istanbul) needed to be rescheduled, which would result in us missing our connection in Istanbul. Following instructions from the airline (AJET), I attempted to amend the booking through GoToGate, expecting them to help us resolve the connection issue.GoToGate informed me that our flights could be rearranged to August 18, which, while inconvenient, was our only option. I agreed and waited for confirmation. Unfortunately, no confirmation arrived, despite my repeated calls to GoToGate two days before the flight, the day before, and even on the day itself. This left me and my four younger siblings (ages 18, 16, 15, and 10) in a difficult position, uncertain if we’d even be allowed on the flight. Ultimately, we missed the flight, and we were forced to remain in Erbil.For nine days following the missed flight, I called GoToGate and AJET daily, only to be passed back and forth between the two companies. Each claimed the other was responsible, and no one offered a solution. This lack of coordination, accountability, and respect for my time left us stranded, with no option but to book an entirely new flight at the last minute, costing an additional $2,000.Throughout this ordeal, GoToGate failed to provide any meaningful support or follow-through on their promises. The entire experience caused us significant financial and emotional distress. GoToGate’s lack of communication and refusal to take responsibility has severely damaged my trust in their services.Desired Outcome: I am seeking a full refund for the initial booking and compensation for the additional costs I incurred. This experience was entirely avoidable had GoToGate provided the level of service expected from a booking agent.I hope this review serves as a warning to future customers. If you value reliable customer service and a company that stands by its promises, I recommend booking elsewhere.",1,Negative,profoundly disappointing experience gotogate family book flight erbil london layover istanbul gotogate august due scheduling issue inform first leg flight erbil istanbul need rescheduled would result we miss connection istanbul follow instruction airline ajet attempt amend booking gotogate expect help we resolve connection issuegotogate inform flight could rearrange august inconvenient option agree wait confirmation unfortunately confirmation arrive despite repeat call gotogate two day flight day even day leave four young sibling age difficult position uncertain we d even allow flight ultimately miss flight force remain erbilfor nine day follow miss flight call gotogate ajet daily pass back forth two company claim responsible one offer solution lack coordination accountability respect time leave we strand option book entirely new flight last minute cost additional throughout ordeal gotogate fail provide meaningful support followthrough promise entire experience cause we significant financial emotional distress gotogate lack communication refusal take responsibility severely damage trust servicesdesire outcome seek full refund initial booking compensation additional cost incur experience entirely avoidable gotogate provide level service expect booking agenti hope review serve warn future customer value reliable customer service company stand promise recommend book elsewhere

"I bought the flight tickets from South Africa to Spain for Xmas. In October, TAAG contacted me because they had cancelled the segment from Luanda to Madrid and Gotogate never advised or contacted me.   The agencies are always informed via queues as I know the process. The airline tried to accommodate us but finally, they passed the responsibility for booking, rescheduling and issuing new tickets to the agency.  GOTOGATE doesn't have customer service and you speak using the chat box with a robot that pushes automatic replies. It was terrible. They never assisted us with this issue. They only sent emails saying ""We are contacting you regarding your request.We are in communication with the airline on the issue and will respond to your query as soon as we have any update on your case.Thank you for your patience""I am still waiting for a solution.

But, annoying is that this service push so many extra options like insurance which I have best multi trip cover with no excess and extra medical or choose seat at extra is just unnecessary and time consuming and boring!

"The company is failing to refund my ticket after 5 months from the refund request. I purchased with Gotogate 2 tickets for June-24 and as the airline cancelled the flights I requested a full refund in May-24 and I have been waiting since.I have called multiple times the customer service and unfortunately the team has committed many mistakes in the process and is unable to help.The first challenge was during the refund request: I had to call 5 times to confirm the refund applications. Customer Service was stating that the one of the flights was not cancelled despite I received this communication directly from Gotogate via email. After many calls they realized and admitted they had an issue in their system and accepted the refund.After many months without a refund in August the team said they had another issue filing the refund application with the airline and they had to resubmit it again.Today it has been 5 months from my refund request and after multiple weekly calls they are still holding the money and the reason now seems that one of the two tickets case got lost. I have been asking to get the refund at least for one of the tickets but they denied even that.All the experience is frustrating and the customer service team while being very nice and available is unable to help. Every person I talked with said different things and they keep redirecting me from one person to another showing lot of confusion, incompetence and lack of accountability in the process. Also, they arrange callback in 24/48 hours from supervisors/managers and they never do, either they call in 1 month time or never do.Consumers cannot be victims of Gotogate mistakes in the application/database.

"I made a search for a flight with Skyscanner, and from the results, I compared the prices against the airline prices.I found that gotogate offered the same itinerary for 840 CHF, while the airline offered it for 1050 CHF, so I went with gotogage.After I entered all the reservation information, and verified that indeed the price was the claimed 840 CHF, I entered my credit card information, and proceeded with the booking.The first booking attempt failed with a generic error message along the lines of ""booking could not be completed"". So I clicked a second time, and this time it went through.However, when I checked the receipt, I could see that I was charged instead 1070 CHF! At NO POINT this amount was displayed to me prior to executing the booking. In other words, they lured me in with a price of 842 CHF and charged me instead 1070 CHF.I contacted the customer service, as I was pretty sure this was a technical error that could be amended. Instead, even though the operator acknowledged that he could see everything that I was describing, he confirmed he could do nothing to amend the price. Instead, he offered to cancel the whole thing for a ""small"" fee of 75 CHF.I told him that they had no right to charge me ANYTHING for an obvious problem on their side, and he insisted he understood how I felt and that he could do nothing about it, leaving me with no option other than to suck it up.I asked to have the issue escalated, and to be involved in the escalation, but he said that he couldn't involve me because that is an internal matter. Internal? I am the damn final customer... how on Earth is that internal?So now I am left here, 200 bucks short, and with no one to be held accountable for this mess up. Saying that I am angry is an understatement. So to all potential customers: unless you're willing to lose money in unexpected ways, and to deal with a company with ZERO accountability, AVOID THIS LIKE THE PEST.

"Two weeks after buying my flight ticket—more than 4 months in advance to GUARANTEE A BETTER PRICE—I received an email saying the airline canceled my flight, and my refund would be processed within a maximum of 15 working days (which is almost a month later). The email from Booking and GotoGate said they had to wait for the airline.A few considerations:When a customer buys something FROM YOU, it’s YOUR responsibility to fix it. The airline is irrelevant to me. If I wanted to deal with the airline, I would have booked through their website. I chose Booking in partnership with GotoGate, so I expect you to solve the problem. It's absurd to say you depend on the airline when you're the one selling the ticket.I contacted Customer Service, and it was by far the worst experience I’ve had. Do you even train your agents, or do you just throw them in there? The agent kept repeating, “I understand your concern” and “Trust that we are doing our best.” Really? How does trusting you help me get my money back so I can buy a new ticket? I am losing time and money every day. If you can’t refund customers who bought from you, you should ensure the airlines you work with refund within the promised time. You are misleading people.If you have a Customer Experience Team, I hope they read this:All I wanted was to go home and see my family after a long year full of illness.

"Would not supply correct invoice. The websites system incorrectly pre-sets invoice country based on the phone number in the order form. Of course the client is not informed of this and somehow it has not crossed GoToGate's mind that a company may have multiple international phone numbers. I asked for the company (through the call centre) to supply me with a correct invoice. I was told that nothing can be done, despite the practice not conforming to the law, as the agent confirmed (I find it crazy that this was admitted and still nothing was done). No immediate help or escalation was offered. I was told that I can contact my lawyer or credit card company. Perhaps that's what I should do.",1,Negative,would supply correct invoice website system incorrectly preset invoice country base phone number order form course client inform somehow cross gotogate mind company may multiple international phone number ask company call centre supply correct invoice tell nothing do despite practice conform law agent confirm find crazy admit still nothing do immediate help escalation offer tell contact lawyer credit card company perhaps that s

"Reasons for my 1-star review are outlined below. I’ve had a few dealings with Gotogate (3 flight bookings in the last 6 months), and found that the experience can range from smooth to extremely poor, depending on whether you need to make changes to your ticket. The cases are listed in order, from good to worst.First flight booked – cheapest fare offered: This was a basic booking with no refunds or changes possible. I received my ticket immediately, great platform. There was no further interaction with them on this trip, and everything went well. Based on this initial experience, I was happy to book more flights with Gotogate—hence my next experiences.Flexible ticket extra not worth it: I paid £70 for the ""flexible ticket extra"" option, anticipating that I might need to change my flight. However, when the time came, I was charged nearly three times my initial ticket price for the change. It would’ve been better to book a flexible ticket directly with the airline—almost the same £70 difference from the basic fare.Refund for cancelled flight: Since paying three times the original ticket price made no sense, I asked to cancel the flight and was informed there would be a charge for that. So, I went directly to the airline’s website and canceled it there (for some reason, this was possible, but changing the flight with the airline wasn’t). The airline refunded £136 after deducting their cancellation fee. After waiting two weeks with no refund, I contacted Gotogate to ask why they hadn’t released the amount refunded by the airline. They asked for a £35 service fee from the £136 refund, plus an additional £50 with no valid explanation. After challenging this and speaking to another agent, they just stopped mentioning the £50 fee without any explanation for why it was being requested in the first place. However, when I received the refund confirmation email, they had deducted £40 instead of the £35 service fee they originally quoted. Talk about business integrity?Adding my infant to another ticket: For the past week, I’ve been trying to get Gotogate to add my infant to my existing ticket. Airlines require a child to be born before booking a flight for them, so the standard procedure is to add the infant to your existing ticket once they are born. This should be straightforward. The agent I spoke to when booking the ticket confirmed this wouldn’t be an issue, but I’ve been waiting for 5 days, and it’s still unresolved.Based on these experiences, I wouldn’t recommend Gotogate, as I’m not convinced they are a trustworthy company.",1,Negative,reason star review outline I ve dealing gotogate flight booking last month find experience range smooth extremely poor depend whether need make change ticket case list order good worstfirst flight book cheap fare offer basic booking refund change possible receive ticket immediately great platform interaction trip everything go well base initial experience happy book flight gotogatehence next experiencesflexible ticket extra worth pay flexible ticket extra option anticipating might need change flight however time came charge nearly three time initial ticket price change would ve well book flexible ticket directly airlinealmost difference basic farerefund cancel flight since pay three time original ticket price make sense ask cancel flight inform would charge go directly airline website cancel reason possible change flight airline be not airline refund deduct cancellation fee wait two week refund contact gotogate ask have not release amount refund airline ask service fee refund plus additional valid explanation challenge speak another agent stop mention fee without explanation request first place however receive refund confirmation email deduct instead service fee originally quote talk business integrityadde infant another ticket past week I ve try get gotogate add infant exist ticket airline require child bear booking flight standard procedure add infant exist ticket bear straightforward agent speak book ticket confirm would not issue I ve waiting day still unresolvedbase experience would not recommend gotogate I m convinced trustworthy company
"Updated// the response tells you everything. No request for further information and no direct email.------‐--------I booked a flight through Booking.com, which uses Gotogate for their flight bookings. Unfortunately, I made a small mistake by misspelling a passenger's name by one letter. When I contacted Gotogate support, they assured me the correction would be handled. After following up multiple times, they claimed to have ""escalated"" the issue, though that didn't seem to result in any progress.I decided to call Vietnam Airlines directly, who confirmed that Gotogate had not been in touch with them. The airline also mentioned that Gotogate is pre-authorized to change up to three characters in a name correction without any approval. Despite informing Gotogate of this policy, they insisted they had escalated the issue even further. It has now been two weeks, and the name is still not corrected.My advice: book directly with the airline. They can make corrections and changes to your ticket immediately. Any small savings you might get by using an agent like Gotogate is not worth the hassle and delays when something goes wrong.",1,Negative,update response tell everything request information direct emaili book flight bookingcom use gotogate flight booking unfortunately make small mistake misspell passenger name one letter contact gotogate support assure correction would handle follow multiple time claim escalate issue though do not seem result progressi decide call vietnam airline directly confirm gotogate touch airline also mention gotogate preauthorized change three character name correction without approval despite inform gotogate policy insist escalate issue even two week name still correctedmy advice book directly airline make correction change ticket immediately small saving might get use agent like gotogate worth hassle delay something go wrong

I would advise anyone who is attempting to book their flight with gotogate not to ever try such mistake. They are a fraudulent agency who after receiving payments will cancel your flight and change it to suit whenever they have an airline available. They are not credible to invest your time and money as they would make a mess of your travel plans. The main reason why they cancel and change your travel date and plans is to extort money from you through charging you a rebooking fee.,1,Negative,would advise anyone attempt book flight gotogate ever try mistake fraudulent agency receive payment cancel flight change suit whenever airline available credible inv time money would make mess travel plan main reason cancel change travel date plan extort money charge rebooking fee

Airplane company answered that they had refund due the medical reasons,but refund is up to agencies,what is completely true,because I had one ticket with same airline bought by the another agency and they made refund imidiately.

Once they start charging you for the luggage (more then the airline as that’s how they make their money) and then the absolute mess that came after. Granted it wasn’t their fault BA cancelled the flight and change the airport but from then it was horrendous, endless phone calls usually involved me having to tell them what’s going on and constantly telling them that the airport has changed and being assured that it was all sorted. When speaking with BA it was anything but sorted and Gotogate just wouldn’t accept it. I could bore you with all the issues but the main issue of luggage being transferred was not getting sorted so I ended up having to go through BA to get more luggage booked on the flight.

When I informed the staff, they told me to take it up with the agency and get a refund.I followed all the necessary steps, but Gotogate denied my refund request twice, despite having clear proof of purchase and receipts. Their customer service is a nightmare – every time I called, I spoke with representatives with strong Indian accents, which made communication extremely difficult. It felt like they cut corners to save costs at every turn.Additionally, I have another flight booked through them that got rescheduled. When I contacted Gotogate to revert it to the original time, I was told I'd have to pay extra fees for that as well! It's absolutely ridiculous.In short, I strongly advise against using Gotogate.

Booked a flexible ticket through booking.com and gotogate. Informed them of a change well within the time frame.

"As a partner with Booking.com, Don't & Don't ever book a flight with themBelieve it or not, this was the absolute worst experience of my life. Do yourself a favor—learn from my mistake and NEVER book a flight with booking.com and their partner gotogateIf you ever need to reschedule, cancel, or request a refund—even on a supposedly flexible ticket—prepare to lose your patience, time, and money. They will play endless games with you, trapping you in a frustrating cycle of non-communication. The only way to contact them is through a chat system, with no option for email or phone support. And their chat representatives have a single, rehearsed response: 'We will forward your request to the support team, and they will get back to you.' Spoiler alert: they never do.When you try to follow up, you're forced to explain your case all over again, only to be told to wait while they 'check your case'—and then, it’s back to square one. It's a nightmare that will leave you wondering whether to laugh or cry out of sheer frustration.I've been dealing with this for more than 10 days now, and in the end, I had no choice but to buy new tickets at a significant cost—money I shouldn't have had to spend if I hadn't made the mistake of booking with booking.com and their partner gotogate. Save yourself the heartache and avoid this company at all costs.Trust me, booking.com is a company that doesn’t respect its customers, and I will be reporting them to every relevant consumer protection agency I can find.

"Terrible experience with Go to Gate. I paid for extra baggage when booking my flights, but the airline had no record of it.

it's been extremely frustration dealing with Go to Gate it's been 5 months and I still haven't received my refund.

I need the money as I'd like to book my next flight as I don't have funds but they have made it very hard.

"I wish there were an option for no stars because that’s what Gotogate deserves based on my experience.As a frequent flyer, I’ve never encountered such frustrating services. Once you book a flight through their platform, they completely drop the ball. My family of 03 couldn’t make it to the airport due to the city blockade, and despite multiple attempts to get a cancellation or refund, I was met with inconsistent information from their customer service staff. It felt like nobody was on the same page.After the flight departed, I called again to request a tax refund, only to be told they marked us as 'No Show' because the airline didn’t acknowledge the blockade, even though the flight was delayed twice for that very reason. To make matters worse, they expect you to pay £35 per passenger just to process the tax refund.Overall, my experience was deeply disappointing.

When checking out, i also somehow got charged for a ""Standard"" premium support for another $30. When i go to cancel, because i later saw this website had bad reviews and sketchy service if there are issues with the flight delays/cancelations, the special kosher meal and the standard support is shown nonrefundable. I go to Air Portugal and instead get the same flight and the 'special' kosher meal is free included. So gotogate certainly stole $10 for a free meal.

"I booked a flight with Gotogate over a year ago, and due to a change of the flight time, I was entitled to a full refund. Despite their initial approval of the refund, I am still waiting for my money after more than 11 months of frustrating delays, excuses, and complete neglect.Gotogate claims they have escalated the case to the airline, saying they can’t issue my refund because the airline has not refunded them yet. However, this is not my problem as a customer. I paid Gotogate not the airline, and it’s their responsibility to refund me, regardless of any delay on the airline’s part. It is shocking that Gotogate would expect me to wait indefinitely while they fail to resolve this with their airline partner.The handling of this case has been nothing short of appalling. I have contacted them multiple times and received nothing but vague responses, with no accountability or urgency to fix the situation. This is an extreme level of incompetence for a company entrusted with managing people’s travel plans and money.The lack of communication and total disregard for customer satisfaction has caused significant financial stress and wasted countless hours and days trying to resolve this. What should have been a simple refund process has turned into a never-ending nightmare with no resolution in sight.To anyone considering booking through Gotogate, I strongly advise you to stay away. If something goes wrong, don’t expect them to be responsive. And if you are entitled to a refund, be prepared for months (or even years) of waiting with no guarantees of getting your money back.I am now preparing to escalate this issue to consumer protection agencies and will take legal action if necessary. No one should have to go through what I’ve experienced.

"I recently booked a flight with Gotogate and within 24 hours, I decided to cancel. To my surprise, I was told I'd be charged a £35 fee to cancel, even though most airlines offer a 24-hour cancellation window with no penalty.

"SCAM! Avoid GotoGate at all costs!We purchased a ticket from GotoGate along with trip cancellation insurance, thinking we were covered in case of emergency. When we had to cancel our trip, they sent us a link to the Manulife website to file a claim and gave us what we thought was the cancellation policy number. After numerous calls and endless back-and-forth, it became clear that GotoGate never created any cancellation policy in our name.When I called GotoGate to request the policy number, they insisted that Manulife should have sent it to us directly, which was not the case. Manulife confirmed there was no policy under my name. GotoGate refused to connect me to a manager to resolve the issue, and every agent I spoke to kept telling me to contact Manulife, essentially passing the buck. They took the money for both the ticket and the supposed insurance, but now we can't file a claim or get a refund.Also, beware of all the extra paid add-ons when booking with GotoGate! The final price we ended up paying was around $1800, while the actual ticket cost was only $1200.This company is a scam—stay far away!",1,Negative,scam avoid gotogate costswe purchase ticket gotogate along trip cancellation insurance thinking cover case emergency cancel trip send we link manulife website file claim give we thought cancellation policy number numerous call endless backandforth become clear gotogate never create cancellation policy namewhen call gotogate request policy number insist manulife send we directly case manulife confirm policy name gotogate refuse connect manager resolve issue every agent speak keep tell contact manulife essentially pass buck take money ticket suppose insurance can not file claim get refundalso beware extra pay addon book gotogate final price end pay around actual ticket cost company scamstay far away

"I booked a solo trip to Greece with Gottogate. My first time using them. One leg of my flight was cancelled by the airline months in advance but I had to inform Gotogate of this change, as they never even knew about it...I simply found out through my own investigation. The process of rebooking me on another flight was put off for months, right up until the morning of my supposed flight. I must have spent 15hrs on hold/on the phone (long distance charges nonetheless) with Gotogate trying to sort it out. It should have been an easy fix and we had plenty of time. I called every week for two months, and then every day, and kept getting the same answer....""your file has been escalated to priority"" and ""someone will get back to you"". No one EVER called me back. As they were finally rebooking me on my flight, I was watching the clock tick toward my flight's departure. The boarding pass printed just as my airplane was pulling out of the gate. So I missed that flight obviously. Then I was able to get rebooked on a later flight and the rest is worked out. But the level of stress I endured in those last few hours, days and weeks leading up to my trip was excessive and completely unnecessary. Everyone I spoke to at Gotogate seemed completely incompetent and evidenced this throughout my dealings with them. I should have looked up reviews first and that was my mistake. Never again will I book with them. I never leave negative reviews but my experience with this company was ridiculous.

"Dear All,There's an airline policy that most passengers are unaware of, whereby a return flight ticket is automatically cancelled, if a passenger misses the first original flight. However, there's a EU Regulation 261/2004/The Air Passenger Rights and Air Travel Organisers' Licensing Regulations 2019, that requires the airline or the booking agency (booking.com in my case) to immediately inform the passenger in a timely manner regarding the automatic cancellation of the return ticket. My cancelled return ticket from British Airways cost me £492.39, via booking.com.British Airways were indeed extremely diligent and professional in informing booking.com regarding my return flight ticket cancellation immediately after the 25-July-2024.However, booking.com failed to inform me (the passenger) about the return flight cancellation as required by law. I bought a new ticket and got to my original destination.Meanwhile, instead of booking.com informing me timely about the automatic return ticket cancellation (as required by law), they did the opposite, by sending me a check-in email 24 hours prior to boarding on my return flight ( which was automatically cancelled without my knowledge few days earlier) .On the day of my return flight (29-July-2024), when trying to manually check-in at the Heathrow airport (British Airways), I was told the original ticket was automatically cancelled five days earlier.Due to the fact I had already queued up for longer than two hours to get to the front of the British Airways desk/booth to check-in, and was already past 17:15, it wouldn’t have been prudent to leave my first place in the queue to buy a new ticket from a different airline without knowing for certain if I would have had to queue up again to check-in and potentially miss my last flight to my destination on the same day (29-July-2024).As a direct result of booking.com blunders, I was left with no other option but to purchase another British Airways ticket while I was still in front of the British Airways check-in desk. The total cost was additional £536.49 .Had I known about my return flight ticket cancellation few days earlier as required by law, I would have bought a new ticket for less than £200.00, and avoid all the stress caused on the day of boarding the plane.After requesting a refund and compensation for the above-mentioned ordeal caused by booking.com, they have refused to comply (this also includes Gotogate). Even after contacting senior employees such as, Mathias Hedlund (the CEO), Glenn Fogel, and other customer service members of staff from Gotogate.As result, I'm seeking legal action against booking.com and Gotogate.Finally, I would like to take this opportunity encourage everyone to avoid using bookng.com for travelling or accommodation, as they have proven to be extremely unprofessional and a bunch of scammers.Stay away from them at all costs.Kind RegardsJC",1,Negative,dear allthere airline policy passenger unaware whereby return flight ticket automatically cancel passenger miss first original flight however there s eu regulation air passenger right air travel organiser license regulation require airline booking agency bookingcom case immediately inform passenger timely manner regard automatic cancellation return ticket cancel return ticket british airway cost via bookingcombritish airway indeed extremely diligent professional informing bookingcom regard return flight ticket cancellation immediately julyhowever bookingcom fail inform passenger return flight cancellation require law buy new ticket get original destinationmeanwhile instead bookingcom inform timely automatic return ticket cancellation require law opposite send checkin email hour prior boarding return flight automatically cancel without knowledge day early day return flight july try manually checkin heathrow airport british airways tell original ticket automatically cancel five day earlierdue fact already queue long two hour get front british airways deskbooth checkin already past would not prudent leave first place queue buy new ticket different airline without know certain would queue checkin potentially miss last flight destination day julyas direct result bookingcom blunder leave option purchase another british airways ticket still front british airways checkin desk total cost additional know return flight ticket cancellation day early require law would buy new ticket less avoid stress cause day boarding planeafter request refund compensation abovementione ordeal cause bookingcom refuse comply also include gotogate even contact senior employee mathia hedlund ceo glenn fogel customer service member staff gotogatea result I m seek legal action bookingcom gotogatefinally would like take opportunity encourage everyone avoid use bookngcom travel accommodation prove extremely unprofessional bunch scammersstay away costskind regardsjc

"Worst Travel Experience Ever - Do Not Use This Agency!I recently had an unbelievably bad experience with this travel agency, and I feel compelled to share it in hopes that others can avoid the same frustrations.It all started when I booked a flight from Amsterdam to Delhi with a stopover in Doha. I paid extra for a check-in service, which was supposed to handle my check-in process and send me my boarding passes 6 hours before the flight. However, the boarding passes were never sent, and I received no information about my trip or any alternative instructions if the passes couldn’t be delivered. As a result, I was denied boarding at the airport because I lacked a transit visa for India—an issue that could have been avoided had I been given proper documentation or even a simple warning about visa requirements.Adding to the frustration, when I called to cancel just my outbound flight due to the visa issue, they went ahead and cancelled my return flight as well—something I never authorized. I clearly requested the cancellation of the outbound leg only. This mistake caused me immense stress and extra financial costs.I tried to get compensation for this, but the agency refused. They didn’t offer any compensation and even refused to refund the taxes that should have been returned after the cancellation. Instead, they told me to contact the airline directly. However, the airline informed me that the travel agency had control over the tickets, meaning they couldn’t help me either.To make matters worse, the check-in service I paid for didn’t work at all, and I never received the boarding passes that could have prevented this whole situation. Because of their unauthorized cancellation of my return flight, I had to pay an additional €500 to rebook my journey. All of this could have been avoided if they had simply sent the boarding passes as promised.On top of all this, their customer service is a nightmare. The agents, based in India, speak such unclear English that it was almost impossible to communicate with them.

"Had a very challenging experience with Gotogate when I found out that on the day of my flight that there is a transit visa requirement where I had to layover for the flights I booked. There was no warning that there may be a requirement when the ticket was booked and I only found when trying to do the web check in.The customer support refused to help with the situation and I had to call the airline myself. The airline agreed to change my flights but as my tickets were booked through gotogate, they asked that gotogate contact them with this request. I called gotogate several times before they finally listened and made these changes 3 hours before I had to leave for the airport. Even then, the support agent who spoke to me to change the ticket was extremely rude as if I was causing her an inconvenience and kept saying they are doing me a favour by changing this.As a customer who used an agency website to book my tickets, I got no support from gotogate to resolve the problem. They refused to even speak to the airlines and when I did and contacted them with a solution, they put me through the anxiety of changing the tickets at the last minute and being rude about it. There was no service by them as agents, all it was was an offer of cheaper flight tickets but you're on your own after that.",2,Negative,challenge experience gotogate find day flight transit visa requirement layover flight book warning may requirement ticket book find try web check inthe customer support refuse help situation call airline airline agree change flight ticket book gotogate ask gotogate contact request call gotogate several time finally listen make change hour leave airport even support agent speak change ticket extremely rude cause inconvenience keep say favour change thisa customer use agency website book ticket get support gotogate resolve problem refuse even speak airline contact solution put anxiety change ticket last minute rude service agent offer cheap flight ticket you re

"After booking a round trip to Baku, the airline (Ajet) cancelled two flights (of the four flights) of the booking, and replaced this with an unsuitable alternative. According to Ajet we could cancel the booking and get a refund. However, ""this should be done by Gotogate"". After contacting Gotogate, a month before the actual flight, they said they would cancel the flight and keep me posted by email. After getting a bit anxious we contacted them again a few days before the original flight date to see the status of the refund. The customer service person told us that she ""could see that the request was made, and that I shouldn't worry"", everything would be fine. Two days after the flight I received a message that ""because of the no-show"" there was nothing that they could do for me... Summary: airline cancelled the booking and was ok with refund.

"Decided to book through gotogate as the ticket was slightly cheaper than going directly with the airline. Due to a wedding, I needed the name on one of the three tickets changed. Then the whole ordeal started..I paid once 40 EUR, but Gotogate told me the airline needed the new passports as proof. The gotogate representative ensured me he will ""freeze"" the ticket until I can provide the documentation. Upon providing the documentation, I was asked to pay 50 EUR again to reopen the ticket. When asked why, I was forwarded to the terms and conditions but there is no price named there. So it feels super arbitrary why for the same ticket and same request I needed to pay two different prices, apart from the fact that I shouldnt need to pay in the first place as the representative assured me.And once they submitted all documentation, I hear nothing. They said it will take 2-3 days. Nothing. I contact them after 5 days, they say ""any day now"". Day 7, nothing. Day 10, nothing. Everytime I reach out, they say any day now and I can reach out to the airline. The airline obviously says I made the booking through a different company and it is their responsibility, rightfully so. On day 11 I hear tomorrow it will be done. Tomorrow comes, nothing, not even a message or information that they reached out and learned something or anything.I can only give the advice: From my perspective it seems that their relation to the airlines is non-existent. Something that through the airline directly should be done in a day or two, I reached almost two weeks before I gave up. Every time they said in the next days but to me it feels like they have no power to provide a customer support that is necessary for an agency.In the end I was forced to ask for the passanger ticket, for which I needed the name to be changed, to cancel the ticket and add it anew to the booking. Obviously, as I was informed, at full cost to myself.I can only warn anyone to always go directly with the airline. Gotogate seems to have no control or power to help their customers in need, and the strategy seems to be 'just let them wait' without giving any information. Moreover, they give you arbitrary durations when something will be solved, just to prolong it not stick to it. And in the end, when the customer is forced to take matters into their own hands, they squeeze them for any EUR they can find, seemingly making up the prices as they go. The whole experience left me speechless and I feel absolutely abused, and I hope that my experience is a warning to anyone thinking about booking through them. Don't. Today is the day I asked for going the route of adding the passenger anew and canceling the ticket in the wrong name. Let's see how long this will take and if it will ever be done in time.Update 13OCT2024 (two weeks until flight):Still not one inch of a progress. Nothing, not on the name change, not on the plan B of adding the passenger anew. Completely left hanging, just a generic response from the gotogate team. Be smarter than me, don't book with them.

Very pathetic experience of booking flight from go to gate website. They did not told us about the need of transit visa in Germany for the flight from India to Manchester. There was no pop up for showing transit visa requirement for the lay over of just 2 hours and in return the airline did not allowed us for boarding.

It was quiet disturbing night for us as we were roaming on the airport for some help but they did not provide any help and then we came back home and booked another flight of next day.

"27/9/24: Imagine my dismay today when dropping my bag on the check-in conveyor belt in Penang and being told that I couldn't be ticketed because I didn't have a visa for India, enroute to Rome.  My GoToGate travel document specifically states: 'IMPORTANT: print out this travel document and bring it with you on your trip along with your valid passport'.  So that's just what I brought - no visa for India, as it clearly wasn't indicated.  And it's a minimum of three days to get one.  Livid.So now I'm out ~AU$1k for that flight, which unfortunately departed on time (so no flight credit available), and this afternoon I had to purchase new flights totaling ~AU$2k, but getting me to Rome two days later than planned, which of course stuffs up a number of other plans I had with my wife, who is already waiting for me there.In this case, I'm not sure if Air Asia stuffed up, or if GoToGate stuffed up, as I'm aware that airlines do have certain responsibilities around situations like this one, but as a relatively frequent international traveler, I'd expect that booking emails, including attached travel documents, would highlight the need for visas, front and centre; with all the AI we have at the moment, it should be pretty @#$%! easy to understand and communicate visa requirements in about 10 nanoseconds.  Maybe 20 nanoseconds, tops.So now I'm off to Rome via Kuala Lumpur, Kazakhstan and Doha over the next two days, AU$3k lighter in my pocket, thanks quite possibly in part to GoToGate.

"I booked 2 tickets yesterday and chose Gotogate; I denied all extra services and went to the pay section. I paid, was sent back to the Gotogate website and got a message ""something went wrong, try again in a few minutes"". Checking my bank account I learned that the full amount had been paid, so I didn't want to try again. I never received a booking confirmation in my e-mail.It took me a lot of energy to contact Gotogate because I didn't have a booking number. When I finally spoke to them on the phone, the Indian-english speaking person told me that I should wait for 24-48 hours for the confirmation (which I find hard to believe since normally you receive those instantly after payment) and otherwise I should go to my bank to get my money back, which I find hard to believe because banks don't retrieve money from other parties, that is up to the sender and the receiver. I feel really bad about this situation. I seems like I should book again (this time choosing another party instead of Gotogate of course) and that it is going to cost me a lot of time to retrieve my money!30-9-2024: Gotogate reacted here with their standard text, see below. I did already contact their customer service, see my review above, and they haven’t helped me yet. I will try again, because of course I want my money back (or two tickets!).

They changed the date, made me pay the difference and Go to Gate sent me the new link with new booking for amended date. At the airport I got boarding pass went through security and to the gate when we came to realise that boarding pass was printed out for the old date. Following multiple calls to booking.com flight service my ticket was raised and escalated but not resolved on the day. I ended up waiting at the airport for 8 hours and had to make a hotel reservation while they are still investigating what happened, instead of prioritising me as a customer that has been unable to fly and was not provided any resolution within 24 hours - all because booking.com has made a mistake. I will make a formal complain and make the escalation as much as possible. In the mean time I will make anyone I know aware to avoid booking.com like a plague - A multibillion company in revenue.At this point I am not sure if this was error made by go to gate but because of the delay that this has caused and the resolution that was not presented to me on the day Go to Gate is also responsible.",1,Negative,dear go gateprovide detail booking fyi hour phone call bookingcom go gate possible resolution situation week since initial complain one get back meticket booking reference n x h h lorder ticket eticket numberbooking reference sybtzforder number samego gate receive negative review due bookingcom affiliatenever issue bookingcom time enough make family take decision never use ever flight book possibility change date flight reach customer service ask bring date forward change date make pay difference go gate send new link new booking amend date airport get boarding pass go security gate come realise boarding pass print old date follow multiple call bookingcom flight service ticket raise escalate resolve day end wait airport hour make hotel reservation still investigate happen instead prioritise customer unable fly provide resolution within hour bookingcom make mistake make formal complain make escalation much possible mean time make anyone know aware avoid bookingcom like plague multibillion company revenueat point sure error make go gate delay cause resolution present day go gate also responsible

"Gotogate often offers competitive prices, frequently providing some of the lowest fares available. This is especially true when accessing their site through Google Flights links.However, there are several frustrating aspects to the booking process, which I really don't understand why they don't fix or eliminate:1. Price volatility: Prices tend to increase if you refresh or search directly on the site, refresh the page or take time to consider your options. This creates pressure to book quickly.2.Short booking window: You need to complete your booking within minutes (3 minutes it expired!) before the price expires, which can feel rushed and stressful.3.Excessive upselling: The checkout process includes numerous offers for insurance and other add-ons. We got used to it as consumers, but Gotogate's offers are really long! While these may benefit some travellers, the sheer volume of offers can be overwhelming and may take advantage of less experienced buyers.",4,Positive,gotogate often offer competitive price frequently provide low fare available especially true access site google flight linkshowever several frustrating aspect booking process really do not understand do not fix eliminate price volatility price tend increase refresh search directly site refresh page take time consider option create pressure book quicklyshort booking window need complete booking within minute minute expire price expire feel rush stressfulexcessive upselle checkout process include numerous offer insurance addon get use consumer gotogate offer really long may benefit traveller sheer volume offer overwhelming may take advantage less experienced buyer

"They don't care about you unless you publish an utterly bad review on social media.  1) You won't be able to speak to anyone except the 'customer care' team, who can only say sorry and reply that everything is out of their control and they have no access to any helpful information.2) You paid them for the tickets, but they won't refund you unless the airline refunds them first. -- The sales contract is made between the customer and this agent, NOT the customer with the airline. Hence, if you try to call the airline, they won't speak to you either! -- What this company tells the customers is utterly nonsense. And their team is trained to tell you nothing helpful.3) When the refund is supposed to take  5-10 working days, as stated in their no-replayable emails, their reply on the phone is kinda 'We will escalate for you, but we will not contact you, and no progress can be guaranteed.

"Disastrous Experience with Go to GateI had an incredibly frustrating experience with Go to Gate. I booked airline tickets through them and received a confirmation email. Just three hours later, I got another email saying that my tickets were canceled due to a ""technical fault"" and that the money had been refunded to my account without any consultation or prior notice. This caused significant inconvenience as I had already made non-refundable hotel reservations, applied for a visa, and submitted a leave application to my employer.The refund process is even more problematic. The money is expected to take 3-5 business days to return to my account, which may be further delayed by international transaction issues with credit cards. To make matters worse, when I tried to resolve the issue by calling their customer service, I was on hold for nearly three hours before the call was abruptly terminated.Throughout this ordeal, Go to Gate has not offered any apology or reimbursement for the trouble caused. Their customer service is severely lacking, and their handling of my situation has been unacceptable. I would strongly advise against using Go to Gate based on my experience. Their lack of transparency and inadequate support are deeply disappointing.",1,Negative,disastrous experience go gatei incredibly frustrating experience go gate book airline ticket receive confirmation email three hour later get another email say ticket cancel due technical fault money refund account without consultation prior notice cause significant inconvenience already make nonrefundable hotel reservation apply visa submit leave application employerthe refund process even problematic money expect take business day return account may delay international transaction issue credit card make matter bad try resolve issue call customer service hold nearly three hour call abruptly terminatedthroughout ordeal go gate offer apology reimbursement trouble cause customer service severely lack handle situation unacceptable would strongly advise use go gate base experience lack transparency inadequate support deeply disappointing
"It’s incredibly frustrating. I booked a flight for my wife to visit her family in Canada for Thanksgiving, as she hasn’t seen them since COVID. Being in the British forces, planning this was quite challenging. I even paid for premium economy to make it special.Five weeks before the flight, I received a message saying part of the journey was canceled due to “operational reasons” and was rescheduled. Then, three weeks before the flight, I got another message stating that part of the return leg was also canceled for the same vague “operational reasons.” The only option given was a full refund, which I have to wait up to 15 days for. No alternative flights or compensation were offered. The trip is now completely ruined, and rebooking at this point means paying triple the original price. Thanks for nothing. Absolutely rubbish.",1,Negative,incredibly frustrating book flight wife visit family canada thanksgiving have not see since covid british force plan quite challenging even pay premium economy make specialfive week flight receive message say part journey cancel due operational reason reschedule three week flight get another message state part return leg also cancel vague operational reason option give full refund wait day alternative flight compensation offer trip completely ruin rebooking point mean pay triple original price thank nothing absolutely rubbish

"Dear Sir/Madam,I and my wife booked a flight from Istanbul to Bali with Qatar Airways (22.09.2024 – 02.10.2024), using Gotogate company as an agent. I booked this flight on 5 September 2024. But the next day (6 September) I learned about the medical condition of my wife (high-risk pregnancy) which makes us unfit to travel, and applied for cancellation of our booking to Gotogate by calling your customer service in Türkiye.Your customer service confirmed that cancellation was within the 24-hour full refund period of Qatar Airways and the ticket price would be fully refunded. They told me that I needed to submit a medical record only to get refund for Gotogate's fees as well, which amounts to a fraction of our booking amount. I explicitly asked again whether my ticket fee would be fully refunded because of the 24-hour period regardless of the medical report, and they said “yes”.I submitted the medical report on the next business day (9 September 2024) through your system. However, I received an e-mail from Gotogate a few days later (13 September 2024), saying that ""according to the rules set out by the airline, it is not possible to request a refund against indicated reasons"". I called the customer service again, and they told me that the booking was already cancelled, and I should be entitled to full refund of the ticket excluding Gotogate’s fees. But they also told me that the relevant department of Gotogate has not responded them, and I should wait for their response.On 16 September 2024, I received another email from Gotogate, which says “the airline has responded negatively to our refund request. The airline has stated that they have reviewed the certificate sent but that it is not suitable for refund according to their own policies. … Since the airline has rejected our request, we cannot take any further action on this file”. When I called Qatar Airways, they confirmed this decision, and explained that the refund request was not made in the first 24 hours. I called Gotogate customer service again and reminded them that my original request was regarding my right to the 24-hour refund period, and it was their fault if they did not exercise it. They said this would be directed to another department, and hopefully refund would be granted. Until this point, I talked to the same customer service representative in each of the calls mentioned above, who was aware of the situation and remembered our previous conversations.After not receiving further notifications, I called the customer service twice on 18 September 2024. This time different representatives answered my call and told me that my complaint is being investigated through examination of previous phone call records with the customer service. When I asked about when this investigation would be completed, they had no idea. However, this issue must be resolved before the end of business day on 19th September 2024, so that I have enough time to take other actions with Qatar Airways (re-booking, etc.) before the original date of flight.To sum up, it is Gotogate customer service team’s fault that they did not exercise the “first 24-hour refund right” on our behalf, although I informed them timely. Denying my refund is not only unfair, but also conflicts the information provided to me by Gotogate customer service in several calls.I demand full refund of my payment before the end of business day on 19th September 2024. Otherwise I will have to escalate this issue with the Financial Ombudsman services in both Türkiye and the UK (where I am a resident), Swedish Consumer Agency (where your company is headquartered), as well as my credit card provider chargeback service.Regards,Edit on 20 September 2024: I received an email from Gotogate customer service today, which says: “According to the call records you made to our customer service on September 6, 2024, it is understood that you decided to cancel due to GDPR after the officer told you that Qatar Airways did not have a cancellation policy within 24 hours. In fact, it is recorded that you also submitted the GDPR documents requested from you after the cancellation. … Since the airline rejected our request, we cannot take any further action on this file”.This statement does not reflect the truth at all, since the customer service expilicitly confirmed that Qatar Airways had a cancellation policy within 24 hours during our call on 6 September 2024. It is a shame that Gotogate is manipulating the truth, and providing wrong information about my previous call with their customer service. I will proceed with escalating this issue to Ombudsman services and consumer agencies, as well my credit card provider chargeback service.

"This company is horrible. I booked a flight through them and they scammed me. At checkout, the total cost of the flight was $1,696.89 but when I pressed pay, the amount they removed from my card was $2,679.18. I have called and messaged them and all their agents keep telling me that there is nothing they can do and that I have to pay hundreds of dollars to cancel my flight. I explained to them that it must have been a glitch in the system because I went to check the same flight after booking and total cost with all the charges was still $1,696.89. I have explained and keep explaining but they keep telling me there’s nothing they can. How on earth does that make sense, the worst part is that receipt shows that the taxes for a $1,696 flight is $1,164.89. How!!!?

"I will NEVER BUY FLIGHTS FROM GOTOGATE nor BOOKING.COM again.The first experience will be my last experience, as it has been horrendous.I actually purchased the flights via Booking.com.My Booking.com reservation shows the fare which I purchased correctly, it also explains the entitlements of the fare I purchased correctly. GotoGate cannot support, and now try to defer me to a 3rd company, their parent etraveli.com.I received an email immediately post paying for the flights, it explained that a second email will be sent later with the details. 15 mins later the email was received but with the basic fare conditions, not with the additional fare conditions that I had purchased (and which my Booking.com reservation shows).I immediately contacted booking.com to question the issue via their online support chat.The online support chat could not reference anything with regards to my reservation, except basic flight information.Later I  know it was not booking.com's online support but booking.com directed it to GotoGate support.The support told me to write to GotoGate's email, sending bank statements to itemise what I had paid for. Yes my bank statements show how much I paid but not what it as I was paying for.I sent email(s) to GotoGate, with screenshots which I had taken while making the purchase, which showed the fares options offered, and the fare price which aligned with the amount I paid, and the fare's benefits on my booking.com reservation.  I sent a number of emails to GotoGate,  GotoGate did not respond nor acknowledge receipt of one single email.I tried online support to get an acknowledgement. One agent told me I had not sent any information in emails to GotoGate. I copied and pasted some contents from various, to show them. The agent disconnected when I asked them, why would they claim I had not sent any emails?I tried the phone support directed to from Booking.com.Another lie, it was not Booking.com but was GotoGate pretending to be Booking.comI learnt this after 3 weeks of calling, when agents changed how they answered the phone to ""GotoGate in partnership with Booking.com"".This explains a number of the issues. i.e. GotoGate staff cannot see what is on my reservation on booking.com. They ask you to send screenshots, then do not acknowledge receipt of any email, even when asked to acknowledge.One phone agent did acknowledge that they were receiving the emails and attachments, and then acknowledged an old email in writing when I asked..""GotoGate"" staff when pretending to be Booking.com agents, said I that I should raise a complaint on booking.com.I did raise a complaint, only be to told by Booking.com, that complaints can only be raised for accommodation reservations, and there is not a system to raise complaints for flight reservations. Real Booking.com staff in email exchanges. told me to call booking.com phone numbers to try get help. All of the phone numbers provided were blocked by requiring a ""Confirmation number"" and PIN number. Flight bookings with Booking.com instead provide a ""Customer reference"" number and PIN, which do not allow phone support.  I  made a hotel reservation with booking.com, so I could get through the booking.com phone system. The Booking.com staff said the only option they had was to direct the call to their ""supplier""(GotoGate) GotoGate managers were supposed to callback in 48 hours, but no manager called within 2 weeks.I requested a callback again. which has occurred.The ""Manager"" repeated the lie, that I had not sent GotoGate any information.Then told me Booking.com did not acknowledge, the conditions which I purchased. I could not believe the person, after the first lie. They provided a mechanism for me to upload all the information I had previously sent to make my claim.Shortly after uploading 15 attachments and explanations, I receive a boiler plate response.""After careful review, we regret to inform you that we are unable to confirm any errors occurred on our side.""I did not claim the errors occurred on their side, but had expressed I believed it was the fact that two systems were being used ""Booking.com"" and GotoGate.I tried to follow up to see if their careful review was capable of answering the 3 simple questions.I received a response to contact a 3rd company ""etraveli.com""Booking.com sold the flights and provide zero sales support.GotoGate, pretends to be Booking.com but cannot support the booking as purchased, as they have different information.GotoGate's agents lie.The systems are not in place.

"I booked a family trip through Gotogate on April 9th, 2024. Immediately after booking, I noticed one of the passengers was missing a last name. I contacted Gotogate right away, as this was still within the 24-hour cancellation window. They told me I needed to contact Emirates directly.After contacting Emirates, the confusion began. Emirates stated that they couldn't make the name change and that Gotogate needed to handle it. Over the past 5 months, I’ve contacted both companies multiple times. Emirates has been consistent in stating that Gotogate is responsible for making the change. However, Gotogate kept giving me different reasons for why they couldn’t do it. First, they claimed they couldn’t reach me, then they said the change wasn’t allowed, followed by the excuse that the name change was too long (more than three letters). Lastly, they claimed they’d have to rebook the flight but said there was no availability, which I confirmed wasn’t true by checking Emirates' site in real time.Gotogate said they would escalate the issue, but I only received the same generic responses instructing me to contact Emirates. After 5 months of back-and-forth and countless hours on the phone, they still haven’t resolved the issue. This could have been fixed within the first 24 hours, but now I’m at risk of having to purchase a new ticket and pay the fare difference.I highly advise against using Gotogate.

"I booked flights to and from Turkey with GTG. Paid for 4 x hand luggage in each. Flight out was fine. Flight return home was told by airline at boarding gate that we had to pay €80 euros to take hand luggage on. Showed them the GTG booking confirmation. They said they go by what is on the system and no hand luggage showing. We had to pay the money and were told to speak to tour operator about their error and request a refund from them. Done this several times by phone and email. Each time they apologise on the phone, listen to the whole tale and promise me that someone will get back to me and deal with it. I have sent the invoice from the airline several times, after GTG request this by completing an online form. They even wrote an email to say they made an error by not putting the hand luggage in the system. I request a refund of the monies I paid unnecessarily to the airline. Then when some time passes and I request an update, I get an automated message saying my query cannot be registered as the e tracker reference they attach to my complaint has been finalised and closed.

I have spent over 300 minute on the phone, and over $100 in international calling charges and am yet to speak to a supervisor who can hear my request.In a nutshell, the airline has a policy listed on their website that sounds a little strange, but hey - it is listed on their website in plain language. The policy relates to adding an infant to a ticket, so the option of not fulfilling the policy obligation would result in me needing to leave my son in Europe while my wife and I returned home. So it is not a small issue, it actually renders the tickets unusable if not fulfilled. Immediately after booking (via chat), I asked Gotogate to confirm the policy with the airline. The said they would but then a few days later I got a NO reply email saying ""Contacting the airline has been unsuccessful"" so they can NOT confirm and suggested I try contact the airline directly. From here I guess you can see where this is going. I spent hours contacting the airline (with whom I have no relationship), for them to tell me that they can not speak with me as the ticket was booked through Gotogate, but ""off the record"" they believe the policy is wrong and asked I request Gotogate to contact them to rectify the problem. So back to Gotogate I go, and again try to explain the need for them to contact the airline. They again refuse, saying it is too hard, and that they are not permitted to contact the airline. They suggested the BEST option I have is to cancel the booking with NO REFUND (~$1500 loss). I explained to them how that wasn't an option for me and that the airline had suggested this was something they would be able to fix with them if contacted, OR process a refund if a solution is not found. Gotogate refused to contact. In their eyes, the policy issue was an airline issue that they didn't need to help with (the airline didn't see it that way). And that the refund request, even though resulting from a policy issue, was not exceptional enough to allow them to contact the airline to discuss, even though the airline had recommended that action. Sure I'm obviously dealing with someone not very empathetic or bright, I repeatedly request to have the case heard by a team leader/supervisor as I refuse to believe their company policy disallows the action in such exceptional circumstances (I mean, I'm not just asking for a refund on a no refund ticket - its more complex) and asked for a copy of their policy in the instance they can't escalate. Note: This was so I can provide it to my insurance company to seek compensation, to which Gotogate obviously declined. So this is where we are at... as I said earlier, I have called the call center many times, sat on hold for hundreds of minutes, only to have my call ended in some instances ""cut out"", or be told that a supervisor would call me back at a time of their choosing, (however, always outside of my available hours) - resulting is a death spiralling No Reply email asking me to call the call centre and speak to a supervisor again. The process continues over and over. As I mentioned, this is by far the worst travel-agent/customer experience I have ever had -  stay away at all costs.By contrast, I had the SAME issue with Trip.com, I sent them a screen shot of the policy and an email from the airline saying they could not honour it. They (Trip.com) processed a refund within 24 hours.Do yourself and the world a favour. Avoid these crooks and let companies like this go where they need to to die. They do not service anyone and instead erode the services of good actors who have to compete with them for a few pennies.",1,Negative,rarely write review gotogate next level bad spend minute phone international calling charge yet speak supervisor hear requestin nutshell airline policy list website sound little strange hey list website plain language policy relate add infant ticket option fulfil policy obligation would result need leave son europe wife return home small issue actually render ticket unusable fulfil immediately book via chat ask gotogate confirm policy airline say would day later get reply email say contact airline unsuccessful confirm suggest try contact airline directly guess see going spend hour contact airline relationship tell speak ticket book gotogate record believe policy wrong ask request gotogate contact rectify problem back gotogate go try explain need contact airline refuse say hard permit contact airline suggest good option cancel booking refund loss explain be not option airline suggest something would able fix contact process refund solution find gotogate refuse contact eye policy issue airline issue do not need help airline do not see way refund request even though result policy issue exceptional enough allow contact airline discuss even though airline recommend action sure I m obviously deal someone empathetic bright repeatedly request case hear team leadersupervisor refuse believe company policy disallow action exceptional circumstance mean I m ask refund refund ticket complex ask copy policy instance can not escalate note provide insurance company seek compensation gotogate obviously decline say early call call center many time sit hold hundred minute call end instance cut tell supervisor would call back time choose however always outside available hour result death spiral reply email ask call call centre speak supervisor process continues mention far bad travelagentcustomer experience ever stay away costsby contrast issue tripcom send screen shoot policy email airline say could honour tripcom process refund within hoursdo world favour avoid crook let company like go need die service anyone instead erode service good actor compete penny

I have been trying to tell Gotogate to cancel a trip on Ethiopian Airlines for 2 passeners from Atlanta to Johannesburg on the 20th of September since 9 September - I've contaced them every day (date is now 14 September) after Ethiopian airlines cancelled the plane and changed the departure airport.But they have still not cancelled the flight and requested a refund because I'm still getting emails from Ethiopian airlines asking if I want to upgrade my flight to business class.

"It is my moral obligation to do whatever I can to let people know that this company is a scam.Etraveli Group owns MyTrip and Gotogate. this parent company will do whatever they can to scam you out of your money and will deny refund for any reason whatsoever. look at other reviews that say the same thing.Imagine in any circumstance that a company sells you a ticket to a service or product that never once existed and then they proceed to blame the original party that they supposedly booked through. They never intended on giving me this flight.The flight was from Sao Paulo (Campinas) to Dallas with a layover in Fort Lauderdale. When I spoke with the desk representative for Azul airlines they had my name under a flight that was on a day 2 days prior stopping in Manaus in the Amazon then after going to Fort lauderdale and then dallas. I have never confirmed this and they booked me on a series of strange flights that I never confirmed. They are now repeatedly telling me now for the 3rd time that they are refusing to refund my ticket as ""per the airline's rules"" the problem is that this is not the airline's fault this is fully the fault of MyTrip for booking me on a flight that never existed. This company is a complete scam and should not be allowed to operate. My advice. this company doesn't want you to know that you can easily book the same flights directly through the same airlines that they offer for the same competitive prices, by booking directly you will be treated like a human being and you will also have the opportunity to gain airline miles and to get further rights to cancellation and membership. Don't fall for the ease of these 3rd party scams. By never booking with this immoral corrupt company the company will go out of business.Edit: See below reply, MyTrip has REFUSED to give me a refund for something that is their fault. They have booked me on a nonexisting flight and are pretty much telling me I won't get a refund for something that is completely their fault. This is criminal.

A month before planned departure, I was informed by Gotogate (and the airline in a separate mail) that the airline had cancelled my flight. Because an alternative was not available, I was due a refund. This was not ideal because it required buying a more expensive flight at shorter notice. I requested the refund. For a month I was enquiring about the status of my refund but also asking why the flight was still showing up at Confirmed. The same excuse was that they were waiting on the airline to process the refund. The proposed flight has been and gone. Still no refund.I've now been just told that I can't be refunded because I was classed as a ""No show"" by the airline. But they told me my flight was cancelled. What the...?!

"I have never felt so frustrated between this company and Aer Lingus and I’m set to lose a lot of money. The staff are lovely but I’ve been trying to make changes since 19/8 and absolutely nothing. You certainly don’t get to speak to a manager so no use trying that either. I booked business class tickets to New York £5000 approx. Through no fault of his own, my husband couldn’t make it so I asked for the name to be changed on the ticket to that of my friend. Up until Saturday ( 4 days before the flight) this still hadn’t been done! I couldn’t wait any longer because I had hotels and a trip and show to cancel so I asked to simply defer the journey. This I am entitled to do on my ticket. But they can’t do this because they are unable to get the price to make the change from Aer Lingus. I contacted the less than helpful Aer Lingus who said that all this company need to do is give them a ring! Now 2 days before the flight, still nothing. I have recorded conversations and I have the message from aer Lingus saying they can be reached by phone ( ??) in order to rebook. I just can’t see it happening now. I’m very upset. We are not wealthy people. This was our amazing retirement gift to ourselves which we had saved hard for and which I had used some of my NHS receptionist retirement fund for! We are now going to have the stress of legal action because we can’t afford this. It’s a complete waste of time ringing because no one will help. Or can help! The staff are very nice.

"Booked a flight from LGW to DLM months ago, and we are due to fly tomorrow and after many phone calls to GoToGate over the last few weeks, they STILL have not told us the airline we are flying with. Nor did they ever call back when promised.Our email confirmation states we are flying with ‘Hahn Air Systems’. After a lot of Googling, I found that this is a German company that bulk buy tickets and sell them to different airlines. Hahn Air does not have a Terminal at LGW, so currently we have no idea where to go at Gatwick.I finally spoke with an agent this morning at GoToGate who after having me on hold for almost 10 minutes told me that we are flying with ‘XC Airlines’, but was still unable to tell me which Terminal we should go to. They did however, provide me with a Flight number. I go straight to the Gatwick website after the phone call, and find there is no ‘XC Airlines’…It was only from a reddit post that I learned ‘XC’ is the code for Correndon Airlines.I then attempted to check-in online at Correndon Airlines, but they have no record of my Surname and the Flight number does not seem to exist, and because of this, they won’t allow me to fill in a support ticket. They have to have a record of who you are, to be able to help you…NIGHTMARE!! Finally I found a phone number for Correndon Airlines and spoke to a helpful lady, who after a few minutes was able to locate me on the system. She had asked me for a PNR number, which GoToGate should have provided me with, but they did not. In the end, it turns out the Flight Number that GoToGate gave me was incorrect!!!I hope this review helps someone else, so they don’t have to go through what I went through to get the correct information needed to actually be able to go on holiday.GoToGate are one of the most unprofessional outfits I have ever dealt with. They do not provide accurate information, and the fact they couldn’t even tell me who I was flying with is criminal, especially for a travel agency.In summary:Hahn Air is NOT an airline, it is a ticketing system.Correndon Airlines operates from the South Terminal, and only allows check-in 24hrs before departure.*Since writing this review, they have called me to tell me I am flying with Hahn Air (no I am not) and need to check-in using their website.

"I recently had a horrible experience with GotoGate after a leg of my flight was cancelled. The airline informed me that they could change the flight, but GotoGate needed to amend the booking. What followed was an exhausting and infuriating series of calls and emails.First, I spent over an hour on the phone with GotoGate's customer service team, who falsely told me the flight wasn’t cancelled. After confirming with the airline that it was cancelled, I had to call GotoGate again, which led to another 1.5 hours on the phone. Despite the airline clearly stating that GotoGate was responsible for making the changes, GotoGate’s scripted responses kept blaming the airline.After yet another hour and a half, I finally managed to escalate the issue. I emailed the flight cancellation confirmation from the airline, and was promised a response within 24 hours. All I got was an email confirming the cancellation—information I already knew!For two days, I chased GotoGate via email with no updates to my booking. When I called again, I spent another hour being told that their systems were down, and they couldn’t help me or escalate the issue. After being on the phone for over an hour, the call was disconnected.In total, I wasted over six hours on the phone, dealt with multiple instances of misinformation, and experienced extreme delays and still no resolution.

I waited for 3 days, only to be told by your confused collaborators to keep waiting with no resolution in sight. Regrettably, the only choice left was to cancel everything and request a refund.

Our return flight on 10/26 from Naples to Chicago was cancelled on 8/19  I contacted Go To Gate online twice that evening regarding rebooking the flight with no results.  I phoned the next day asking if it would be possible to rebook us on a flight from JFK to ORD leaving at 15:29 arriving at 17:20 and was told it would have to be sent to the airline for approval.  I had checked and this flight was available online.  A week later I still had not heard anything so I called again only to be told after fully explaining the situation again that the request would be sent to a team leader to escalate.  Now another week later I have heard nothing so I called again only to be told there is nothing Go To Gate agent could do as they were waiting to hear from the airline.  I do not understand why this is taking so long to resolve.  Now if we accept a refund we will have to rebook our flights at a much higher cost than the flights we booked in February.

"The worst experience. No Service at all. Unfortunately we booked via gotogate a Singapore flight with connection in Singapore to Cebu. Seems as Singapore changed the connecting flight to an earlier time so they would not have been able to still catch this one. We waited a week for confirmation to get the flight rebooked without any solution.

"I must say that I’m TOTALLY disappointed the way you handle the customer support and what a horrible experience I had for 5 days to change one single segment of the ticket due to the fact that airline canceled the flight.  Normally as ticket was bought thru you, you are the responsible to offer another flight and amend the ticket as the airline will not change the ticket as is your PNR and you’re booking so you are responsible for that booking.If you call their call center you can spend more the 46 min online call in USA and you will get all the time answering machine you are first on the que and you can keep on waiting and you will never get a response. If you contact them thru support chat they will change all the time and you start again and again all over I have speak and explain over and over to 15 support agents and they all leave you waiting for hours and everyone will "" rest assure we will solve the issue' and no one does.

"When I booked my flights through Booking.com (see separate review) I had no idea that I would have to rely on GoToGate to get a refund that I am legally entitled to after Saudia Airlines (see separate review) cancelled my flights. I have an email from GTG dated 19th June 2024 that confirms the refund request. According to that email, the process could take up to 10-15 business days, yet here we are 30th August 2024 and I am still waiting.GTG blame the airline and state they can't give me my money back until the airline give it to them BUT when I bought the flights through Booking.com, the contract of sale lies with the company I paid and makes them responsible for the refund. This is a point that both Booking.com and GTG fail to grasp. GTG have told me so many different things that it's pot luck as to whether their response is even remotely related to the enquiry! I've been told they can't give a timescale because of the situation (no idea what that means). I've been told their concern team is working on it and I was then told that the refund is pending and there's nothing they can do until the airline authorises it. Yesterday the same person told me two completely different things in two separate emails. I have an email that states my refund is in the hands of the GTG refund team and not to worry as this is the last stage of the process. Yet when I asked for confirmation that finally the refund is with GTG, I was told once again that the concern team is working on it... what? As someone who doesn't work for GTG, I don't know what each team/department does so I requested confirmation and clarity, yet this morning received a generic, copy and paste response which doesn't provide any reassurances whatsoever!I have consulted a solicitor and read at length, the information on the Civil Aviation Authority website. GTG are clueless and having a chain of companies involved just to get what I am legally entitled to, is ridiculous. Booking.com pass the buck to GTG and GTG blame the airline. In the meantime, it is me, the customer who suffers. I will never use Booking.com again because of this situation.Update after response - The correct ref is: 40-430759764.

"Like child birth I soon forgot of the pain I encountered last time a used GO TO GATE to book a flight, why did I not pay a little extra and book direct!So long story short, airline cancelled route, I have requested a reroute with alternative airline, as per UK legislation, the airline is actually a partner airline of Saudi air whom the flights are booked with. Go to Gate will only offer to refund, albeit judging by the reviews they don’t seem to be honouring. I want rerouting as we have a family safari/beach holiday booked to Zanzibar, there are numerous airlines offering the same route, same days, similar times. Saudi air when I ring them do not seem to think that is an issue but cannot access Go to Gates system on which the original flights are booked and the agent must liaise with them on the via the agents help desk as they are unable to make any new bookings. Go to Gate are claiming Saudi air are refusing to do this (in breach of UK legislation), I have asked for written confirmation from them to confirm this as it contravenes what the airline is saying, they have refused to do so and are no longer replying to my emails. My flight from Uk needs to leave on 19th October to meet our safari provide early morning of 20th October (which I have prepaid a large deposit). Go to Gate have left me with no alternative to start a small claim action against them, very stressful when all we want is what we are entitled to rerouting on a partner airline of Saudi Air.

"I recently used Goto Gate and unfortunately had a disappointing experience with their service. The main issue was that there were hidden charges that were not disclosed on their website. I was surprised to find additional fees on my bill, which were not mentioned anywhere during the booking process. This lack of transparency made me feel deceived, and it has greatly affected my trust in the company. It also caused inconvenience as I had to adjust my budget unexpectedly. I believe clearer communication about pricing would have prevented this issue. It would be helpful if all fees were listed upfront so customers know exactly what they’re paying for. Until these issues are addressed, I wouldn’t recommend Goto gate  to others. The staff constantly keep trying to push the hidden fee to the card company even when we were told multiple times that it was charge by gotogate.

"I strongly advise against booking with GoToGate or any other companies under the Etraveli Group. If the airline makes any changes to your itinerary, GoToGate will make no effort to secure alternative flights for you. I spent dozens of hours communicating with GoToGate, and every time I was reassured that everything would be resolved and that I just needed to wait. Since you booked through an online travel agent, you can't make changes directly with the airline until 24 hours before your outbound flight. Fortunately, the airline was able to adjust my flight 24 hours before departure. Additionally, I paid GoToGate €45 in service fees for alternative flights, but they provided no service. Even getting a refund for these service fees has been difficult, and I have yet to receive it.",1,Negative,strongly advise book gotogate company etraveli group airline make change itinerary gotogate make effort secure alternative flight spend dozen hour communicate gotogate every time reassure everything would resolve need wait since book online travel agent can not make change directly airline hour outbound flight fortunately airline able adjust flight hour departure additionally pay gotogate service fee alternative flight provide service even get refund service fee difficult yet receive

"I'm usually a bit cautious with using these kind of companies and generally prefer to book directly with the airline, or using a reputable company like Flight Centre.However, flights have become very expensive and booking through GTG meant it was around £500 cheaper for a return flight from London to Sydney, so I decided to give them a go.The overall experience was pretty smooth. However, a word of warning: when you think you are paying for seat reservations, you are not actually paying for seat reservations. You are paying an ""admin fee"" to GTG to send the airline your seat preference, with no guarantee that they will honour it.And so it was that having paid to have an aisle seat on all four legs of the journey, I only actually got an aisle seat on two.To me, this seems dishonest and misleading. They shouldn't be charging for something that they have no power to actually deliver, despite what the small print says.

My experience purchasing a flight with booking.com led me to communications with this company. Following an email to customer services I remain booked on a flight that I cannot make. A live chat to amend my flexible ticket advised a departure flight time of 08:10 when in fact it was 20:10.Following weeks of calls & emails I have been told it is my fault as I did not query the time. I requested to speak to someone of higher authority only to be disconnected. I then received an email to say I was somehow disconnected & to try again. What is the point! No one will take responsibility or help me sort this terrible mess out for which I was charged additional funds. The stress has been huge.

Especially that gotogate had not cancelled the booking with the airline or updated booking.com until the return flight. Once they took action the refund was received somewhat slow but pretty ok.

"GoToGate deliberately & knowingly lie to customers. Deny they have your refund even when you supply written proof from the airline when & how they were fully refunded. Contradictory responses, refuse to put you through to someone managerial, with false promises, fobbed off, letters, call backs, & emails all ignored, & even their HQ in Sweden ignore calls & letters.

"The worse company I’ve ever dealt with. I was attending a funeral and had to change a surname of one of the passengers. I contacted go to gate 8 days in advance, I was told to pay £35 and the change would be done. I chased everyday up until the flight and was told over and over someone would call me and it was top priority. The day of the flight the change was still not done. We ended up having to pay £300 for the same flight to make the funeral. On arrival, we received a email from GOTOGATE apologising for the delay and if we hadn’t been able to get the flight to respond back to the email and they’d sort something out. Of course this was another false promise, we emailed back and no response. We were due to fly back three days later so again we spent our whole trip away emailing, chasing and calling. We were PROMISED it had been escalated and they were waiting on the airline. We contacted the airline they had absolutely nothing to do with the name change as we booked through go to gate and it was them who had to make the change. I spent 1 hour on the phone to an incompetent advisor who said if we pay £100 he’d book us on another flight, with no choice we accepted this, 2 minutes later there was no flights available and he said he could not help. I asked how long it usually takes to type in a computer a different surname in which he responsed “ 5/7 days” I explained this was day 8 so why was it not done, he could not answer this and said sometimes it’s different. We are currently on the way to the airport 10 hours before our flight to try and get this resolved. I was told a manager would ring me within the hour after ending the call with the advisor and another shock, it’s been 2 hours and no phone call. Please avoid this company at all costs they are absolutely horrendous and this has been the worse week of my life. I’m currently £300 down & expecting to be down by more once I’ve hopefully sorted a way to get home. Don’t believe a word this company says.

"Sorry, but zero is not the option. I agree, everything could be normal, if there is no problems with your flight. But if there are - they fool you until you give up and just to save your nerves dont want to contact with them any more. Their customer service horrible, zero competent, only lying and giving the prescribed answers.  My flight was cancelled one month before by airplane company. Because I was so stupid, and did not buy the tickets directly but via Gotogate, the rest was complate nightmare. Callcenter or so called customer service told me flight is not cancelled, because it is still in their system. I had to call them more than ten times, send emails with proofs about cancelling, and only I got, were the prescribed answers like me and my team will work with your case, we send you a mail, you are on priority list, we write to airplane company, we have no answer from airplane company and s.o Next time I called all started from beginning, flight is not cancelled, we put you on priority, blablabla. And all this continued more than one month. The best answers were: we wrote to airplane company and they answered they have no access to their emails; airplane company restored the flight and because its fully booked you cant see it in their system. One guy told me they wrote to airplane company on 26/06, the other that on 02/07. One lady explained me the flight existes and she will send me tickets. On a top of the mail was written in bold: THERE IS NO ACTIVE ITINERARY. Then I asked her, does she know, what it means, she said no. I did not give up, I wrote to airplane company and asked for a help. They helped me, I got answer next day. Also I wrote to gotogate and told if I dont get any normal answer in next days, I go to police. So I finally got the full refund.  With their answer to me here on 15.08 Gotogate is again lying.

"Horrible. Do not use if you want to see any assistance or help after disruptions. I booked a flight through them and there happened to be a strike at the airport, meaning my flight was cancelled. As the airline hadn't provided an alternative flight, Gotogate advised me to start a refund process which then prevented me from boarding the alternative flight I ended up being put in (2 days later). This is after 4 hours on the chat with gotogate. The airline wouldn’t allow me to board and gotogate said there was nothing they could do. I couldn’t board my flight and then after all this gotogate states there's no refund with my fare (which they would have known from start but didn't advise). In the end left with no flight (not due to the strike, but due to Gotogate messing with our trip and preventing us boarding) and out of pocket during a cost of living crisis. The company is a scam, after trying to explain to them we've spent over 10 hours on our once in a lifetime trip being passed through so called ""agents"" on their helpline, with 50+ minute waits each time just to be told they need to transfer to someone new, clearly wasting customers time to try tire them out and give up.

"I would leave zero star if I could. I have had such a nightmare with Go to gate. Please stay away from this travel agent. THEY ARE A FRAUDULENT COMPANY.I purchased a scandinavian airline (SAS) ticket with Gotogate in January 2024 to go to New York in August. Unfortunately, my partner had a bereavement and can no longer travel with the kids and I. Because my 9 months old baby has a different surname to me, he was automatically assigned with my partner. I have been calling gotogate continuously since June to reassociate my baby to my ticket so I can travel with my 3 children since they advised this ticket can not be refunded. Each time I speak to Gotogate agents they say the airline has not authorised them to change the ticket. The airline has informed me that no authorisation is needed from them makes such a change and that SAS cannot make any changes to third party agent tickets. When I ask to speak to a gotogate supervisor, I'm told someone would ring me in 24 hours, yet noone does. So for over 2 months, I have been given the run around, when all I want to do is travel with my baby. A week ago, I had a 3 way call a customer representative of SAS and Akash G. From gotogate and he confirmed to me that he can see an authorisation for this change. However, when I rang again to check the progress of this request, I was informed that thw back office cannot make this change as the airline have not given authorisation.My flight is in 24 hours and gotogate sent me an email this morning from a no reply email account saying they cannot help me as the airline have denied authorisation.

Never ever book a flight with them. They are only good with stealing your money for services which you will never get or service that is actually free by the airline. They charged me for luggage which apparently was for free with my classical tickets and I paid money for meals that I didn’t even get during the flight because the airline didn’t have such option. They also misspelled my kids names on the tickets which was such a disaster process to fix the name! They are only stealing money from you. Run away.

"BEWAREGoToGate advertises itself as an online travel agency and seller of air travel. It basically acts as a middleman between customers and airlines. As such, there is a reasonable expectation from the customer that GoToGate will give airlines your contact information in case the airline needs to relay important information, or properly forward that information. In this case, I had booked a flight with Air Arabia through GoToGate that was rescheduled for two hours earlier. I was not properly notified by GoToGate and arrived too late for my flight. When I tried to receive a refund for their mistake, they refused, stating they properly sent the update and that I should take it up with the airline, Air Arabia. When I reached out to Air Arabia, they showed the email they sent and it was not to my email address! It looks like an email address internal to GoToGate that they use. However, they should have provided Air Arabia with my real email address if they cannot forward the emails from the airlines properly.Furthermore, I received TWO reminder/confirmation emails from GoToGate within two days of my flight with the incorrect time listed! If GoToGate is a travel agency and middleman between the customer and an airline, they should not send customers emails with incorrect flight times, which is incredibly confusing and caused me to miss my flight.In summary, GoToGate failed me on multiple fronts. First, they failed to forward a critical update from Air Arabia that my flight had been changed. They listed my email address to their internal email address so that Air Arabia emailed them instead of me and they failed to forward this message to me. Second, they sent me multiple emails days before my flight with the incorrect time, giving me a false sense of security that my flight was scheduled as expected.

"My family had an emergency that required us to book tickets for a flight on the same day. After placing the order online, I didn't receive any confirmation number. Instead, GoToGate only sent an email that says the following:""Thank you for your order. Your booking request has been submitted and is being processed by our team. Your booking should be confirmed within a few minutes. In rare instances, it may take more than 12 hours due to some airlines' processes and technical requirements. For these cases, we appreciate your patience. Please be assured that we will update you as soon as possible and there is no need to reach out to us during this period. Once your booking is confirmed, you will receive a confirmation email with your order number, receipt, and trip details. Whether you paid by card or via bank transfer, the amount has already been reserved in your account. Please do not attempt to make a new reservation to avoid duplicate bookings. Kindly note that the customer support center cannot provide further details at this time. Kind regards, Gotogate""We were very anxious after the booking reference/confirmation email still hadn't arrived 2 hours later. I emailed them a couple times, but didn't get any reply. I then called all 3 numbers I could find online, but it was impossible to get through without a booking number. The website says to use the online chat, but there was no button for it. So basically, we were told to sit and wait indefinitely without any information.Due to the high anxiety and uncertainty (especially since GoToGate's email said it might take over 12 hours to confirm the tickets, which would've been after the flight took off!), I ended up buying tickets from the airline directly.A few hours later, the confirmation came from GoToGate, at which point I tried to get my money back.

"Two problems: Cancelation and no refound.GOTOGATE confirmed my booking, after 8-9h I had a cancelation email. I saw this two days later (the same day I was about to fly). I had to by a new ticket from another company much more expensive since it was the same day.The refound has not been made and if I want to contact them I have to put in the booking number, but the system says it dosent exist, the only other option is the call them to a US number which I guess will be really expensive, no chat or email avalible. If I try to reply the emails from them I get a ""bounce"" email back. I can't recomend them.I have added my booking number so that they can't blame it on that.Update: I manage to find yet another number that actually works and their chat says that they cant see any request of a refound, even if the cancelation email said ""El 100% del valor de la compra ser� reembolsada a la tarjeta de cr�dito con la que se realiz� la compra, recuerde que este abono se ver� reflejado en uno o dos extractos bancarios"".its been a month already!.För att få hjälp måste man vänta länge och om man inte svarar dem på några minuter kopplar de bort en.

"Beware, airlines change flights very often prior to the departure date. Go-To-Gate charges for helping you dealing with the route/time changes, but they will not contact the airline companies to actually sort the issue.They will charge you fraudulent additional fees, but will not help you handling the situation.In my case, after more than 10 calls, the go-to-gate call center staff explicitly told me they don't call the airline companies. They send useless emails that are never read by the airline companies. Therefore, you will spend extra money and yet travel on dates/times that are not the ones you expected.I called the airline (Azul +1 888 587 2985) myself and had everything sorted, except they need Go-to-gate confirmation by phone. All Go-to-gate has to do is to call the airline and confirm the change for no fees.

"Booked a flight to Vietnam through this agency. There a few stops involved to get there and back. I received an email informing me that the last flight had changed times departing 7 hours later than the original time. This means we will be missing our next connection and we would be stranded in the Middle East Airport all night. I got in touch with costumer service and they are the most unhelpful, passing the ball between different departments and giving you wrong information until you can't take it anymore. The main excuse they used is that I had agreed to the change when all I was trying to do is say I didn't agree, but supposedly click the wrong link on the email they sent me which had very confusing wording. I called them right away but still they would not listen. Moral of the story being it might be a little cheaper to book your flights through them but if anything goes wrong you'll be very sorry you did as they will be wasting a lot of your time and you will potentially loose a lot of money plus messing your plans and schedule.",1,Negative,book flight vietnam agency stop involve get back receive email inform last flight change time depart hour later original time mean miss next connection would strand middle east airport night get touch costumer service unhelpful pass ball different department give wrong information can not take anymore main excuse use agree change try say do not agree supposedly click wrong link email send confusing wording call right away still would listen moral story might little cheap book flight anything go wrong you ll sorry waste lot time potentially loose lot money plus mess plan schedule
"Tragic and unnerving experience. We bought a three-leg itinerary on Gotogate: Italy-Thailand, Thailand-China and China-Italy. Tickets issued by Austrian Airlines, last two legs operated by AirChina. One month ago, etraveli (Gotogate's parent company) notified us that the first flight's schedule had been changed by 10 minutes. They didn't ask for our approval, as they should have, but that's all right. The problem is what happened to our booking after this schedule change.Three weeks ago we noticed that the Austrian Airlines app listed our booking as a one-way ticket to Thailand, with no sign of the other two legs. Thinking that was because AirChina operated the flights, we didn't initially worry. Still, out of caution, we called the Austrian call center to check if everything was ok. It wasn't. They said that for all they knew that was indeed a one-way booking and the tickets for the two other legs had not been issued. They said the problem had to be resolved by the agency that did the booking (Gotogate).Here the tragicomedy starts. Gotogate's English call center (that sometimes we waited over 2 hours to talk to) repeatedly assured us that everything was fine with our booking. All they did was send us the PNR over and over again, and tell us to speak to Austrian, AirChina or both. But Austrian kept confirming that those tickets did not exist, and AirChina said that those simply weren't their tickets to issue. One week ago, I was lucky enough to be transferred to the only competent person I've talked to so far, from the Italian call center. He took time to verify, by accessing the Austrian system (why no one else thought of doing that before?), and confirmed that Austrian had never issued the tickets for the second and third legs. He confirmed that we would not be able to check into those flights without a reissue and said that they would contact Austrian to sort everything out.I was relieved, but I was wrong. One week has passed by and the problem has not been solved. I have called Gotogate's call center (both in Italian and English) every day and every single time I have been told that Austrian Airlines has not replied to their request yet. First I was told that everything would be resolved by the 27th; today it's the 31st. Yesterday I was told that it would take ""some time"", but they never know how much time. Today I've been told that they would reissue the tickets ""before the 22nd of August"", which is the date of the 2nd leg of my itinerary. But I'm flying to Thailand on the 7th!! I don't know who's working on this problem. There's never been any transparency. Two days ago I was transferred to an office in India that was supposed to be dealing with the problem. The guy I talked to wasn't even aware that the problem existed and kept telling me our PNR was just fine. I wonder if they are trying to solve this problem at all.Now, picture what would have happened if we hadn't called the Austrian Airlines call center and if we had trusted the first calls with Gotogate's customer service. We arrive at Bangkok airport to take our flight to China, only to discover that our flight does not exist and that we're stuck in Bangkok. Or perhaps it's even worse: without a return ticket from Thailand, maybe we won't be able to enter Thailand in the first place. Are we going to be stuck at Bangkok airport like Tom Hanks in The Terminal? I have no idea, thanks to Gotogate's incompetence.Do yourself a favor and never, ever book with Gotogate. Side note: their ""flexible"" ticket is a joke. When we still believed that our tickets existed, we tried to ask to change the dates of two flights. Also in this case, we had to call multiple times (and wait hours on hold) only to be told that ""the flights are full"" and it was not possible to change. Not for free, not by paying an extra: simply impossible. That was a blatant lie because the airline is still selling seats on those flights at the same fare we bought. So the flexible ticket is a scam and you should never buy it. Sadly, that's the least of our problems at the moment.",1,Negative,tragic unnerving experience buy threeleg itinerary gotogate italythailand thailandchina chinaitaly ticket issue austrian airline last two leg operate airchina one month ago etraveli gotogates parent company notify we first flight schedule change minute do not ask approval that s right problem happen book schedule changethree week ago notice austrian airlines app list booking oneway ticket thailand sign two leg think airchina operate flight do not initially worry still caution call austrian call center check everything ok be not say know indeed oneway book ticket two leg issue say problem resolve agency booking gotogatehere tragicomedy start gotogate english call center sometimes wait hour talk repeatedly assure we everything fine booking send we pnr tell we speak austrian airchina austrian keep confirm ticket exist airchina say simply be not ticket issue one week ago lucky enough transfer competent person I ve talk far italian call center take time verify access austrian system one else think confirm austrian never issue ticket second third leg confirm would able check flight without reissue say would contact austrian sort everything outi relieve wrong one week pass problem solve call gotogates call center italian english every day every single time tell austrian airline reply request yet first tell everything would resolve th today st yesterday tell would take time never know much time today I ve tell would reissue ticket nd august date nd leg itinerary I m fly thailand th do not know who s work problem there s never transparency two day ago transfer office india suppose deal problem guy talk be not even aware problem exist keep tell pnr fine wonder try solve problem allnow picture would happen have not call austrian airline call center trust first call gotogate customer service arrive bangkok airport take flight china discover flight exist stick bangkok perhaps even bad without return ticket thailand maybe will not able enter thailand first place going stick bangkok airport like tom hanks terminal idea thank gotogate incompetencedo favor never ever book gotogate side note flexible ticket joke still believe ticket exist try ask change date two flight also case call multiple time wait hour hold tell flight full possible change free pay extra simply impossible blatant lie airline still sell seat flight fare buy flexible ticket scam never buy sadly that s least problem moment

My flight is in 1 day and still no change, they ""escalated the request now"", whatever it means.

"I am writing to express my utter dissatisfaction with the service provided by Go to Gate regarding a refund that was already approved by the airline.About a year ago, I booked a flight through Booking, which uses Go to Gate as a third-party service. A week ago, I received an email from the airline stating that, due to destination country restrictions, they would offer a refund for the ticket. Several days have passed, and all I get from Go to Gate is that the ticket is non-refundable, communicated through poorly translated emails.When I inform the operator that I have the airline's email confirming the refund, they simply respond that my case will be forwarded to the appropriate department. This has been going on for days without any resolution in sight.The customer service is abysmal. They are unable to provide a clear and precise timeline, and every time I contact them, I receive a different response. This is even more frustrating considering that the airline has already issued several refunds for tickets purchased directly from them.Overall, my experience with Go to Gate has been nothing short of stressful and disappointing.

"We booked tickets through Go To Gate in June for a departure on July 24th. Unfortunately, they provided incorrect information to the airline. We have been in contact with their customer service team for the past week, who assured us it would be handled as an emergency. Despite this, we have not received confirmation even five hours before our departure. When we called again, they suggested we contact the airline in China directly. This is unacceptable and highlights the agency's severe incompetence.We had to cancel the tickets and request a refund. This is a joke—it has ruined our planned holiday. All our schedules had to be changed, including hotels, car rentals, and other tickets. When we inquired about compensation, they informed us that we would not receive any for the hotel and car rental costs. That's unacceptable.We will be filing a formal complaint with the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and Trading Standards. Such a poorly managed agency should not be allowed to continue operating.

"I had booked a flight with this company. I needed to change the flight due to unforeseen circumstances. The person i spoke to suggested I could purchase an open ticket for a future time for £400 extra. Instead of just wanting to charge me the extra £400 they said I needed to pay £3500 for the new ticket price and they would refund me the original cost of the ticket, £3100. I decided I didn't like the sound of this so I asked to just cancel the ticket altogether and I would contact the credit card company. They then proceeded to try put me on hold and then cut off the call. I spent the next half an hour trying to get through, with being put on hold and then cut off.

"I had booked with go to gate three times now and all three times my tickets would get cancelled. Go to gate will then choose tickets themselves and give us complete random timings and dates of departure and arrival. They then have the audacity to blame the airlines and say the airlines have stopped the flights. This is not true because the airlines would still sell the same tickets at the same times. My hotel was booked, car hire was booked and days off from work was booked. The tickets were fairly cheap at the time, and just a few days before the flight the same tickets would double in price. It is apparent that the airlines would cancel your initial ticket and sell it to someone else for much higher. To get a complete refund you then have to wait 10-15 days if not more… you’ll have to chase them up if it is not done within this timeframe which is absolutely unfair and unacceptable.

"I would say, stay completely away from gotogate. They con you. I have had such a bad experience, I still can't believe this has happened. I booked flights via go to gate which was a huge mistake. My flights got cancelled by wizz air. I contacted go to gate after waiting in the queue for over an hour, only for them to tell me to sort it out myself directly with wizzair. Which I then did. Wizz air refunded my money, however they sent it to go to gate. For 8 weeks I was so stressed wondering were the money had went as wizz air had said it had definitely been refunded. I contacted go to gate who apparently had my money for 2 months but didn't think to contact me or refund it to me.  They finally refunded it to my account but taking £350 of my refunded money for a flight which was cancelled.. when questioned them they couldn't give me a reason why they take that money and said it would be £175 which i was not happy about, then they said it would be escalated and I would receive an email. Nothing happened I received the email with the money they will refunding but no  explanation as to why they deducted, which was now £350, especially because they had done absolutely nothing to help me when I went through the ordeal of my flights being cancelled. They did absolutely zero and still deducted the money! For what! Yes I have read terms and conditions, and I still was not clear why the money was deducted from my refund. So I contacted your customer service which mostly have queues of 18 place, I asked for an explanation, he said it has been escalated and you will receive an email, which I didn't receive. All I got was a final total of money no explanation of fees. However gotogate thankyou for your response. I was expecting this kind of response after reading the reviews.

"Honestly wouldnt bother, just pay the extra to go through the airline. Had such a headache with this company and trying to change a few characters which was caused by the provider, not acknowledging their mistake they kept advising me to cancel my booking knowing full well my booking was non-refundable. But upon accepting to cancel they advised me to go directly to the provider just to get me off the phone, upon calling provider they said I have to go through the third party - going in circles. They written to me in an email about I'd receive a full refund and would be honoured but it was not, they nearly out of pocked me by nearly £1k, we just decided to go to the airport on the day with the wrong middle name and luckily enough they let us know. This company has caused so much stress leading up to my holiday I'd never use again.

"My experience with Gotogate has been nothing short of a nightmare. I booked a ticket from Ahmedabad to Brisbane through their platform, only to find out later that my flight from Ahmedabad to Ho Chi Minh City was not included in my itinerary. This meant I had to pay again for another ticket, essentially paying twice for the same leg of my journey. What's worse is that Gotogate had already charged me for the entire journey but failed to transfer the money to Vietjet, the airline operating the Ahmedabad to Ho Chi Minh City flight. As a result, I was left stranded without a valid ticket and had to scramble to find an alternative, costing me dearly in both time and money. I strongly advise anyone considering using Gotogate to book their flights to think twice. They are not just incompetent; they are deceitful. Save yourself the hassle and potential financial loss by booking through more reputable and trustworthy platforms. Gotogate has proven themselves to be nothing short of thieves, taking your money and leaving you stranded without a care in the world.",1,Negative,experience gotogate nothing short nightmare book ticket ahmedabad brisbane platform find later flight ahmedabad ho chi minh city include itinerary mean pay another ticket essentially pay twice leg journey what s bad gotogate already charge entire journey fail transfer money vietjet airline operate ahmedabad ho chi minh city flight result leave strand without valid ticket scramble find alternative cost dearly time money strongly advise anyone consider use gotogate book flight think twice incompetent deceitful save hassle potential financial loss book reputable trustworthy platform gotogate prove nothing short thief take money leave strand without care world

So, I go ahead and put in the information again. I successfully purchased my tickets. Then, I found that I received two confirmations, and my credit card was charged twice. It's no big deal, I think. So, I proceeded to cancel my first reservation. I found that they charge $44 per ticket for cancellation. $44 per ticket for their website issue? Crazy! So I contacted their customer services. I was online for an hour just for a few back-and-forths. Their responses were extremely slow. Nothing helpful was provided. They kept telling me that they could give me an ""exception"" to cancel my reservation for a fee of $44. I told them that I could do it myself on their website. The agent even blamed me for ""not contacting them before the confirmation.""I ended up canceling the reservation and paying $88, and I'm coming here to tell you not to make the same mistake as I did—I mean, try to use Gotogate's service.

Please don't book with them as they are thieves They don't care about you or your problems and don't take responsibility for anything.

"Scam Alert: Avoid Gotogate at All CostsI recently had a terrible experience with Gotogate that I feel compelled to share to warn others.Firstly, this company is not even registered in the UK as they claim.

I encountered significant changes to my itinerary, which, according to their policy, should entitle me to a full refund. However, after numerous attempts to contact them, I have yet to see any of my money returned.Lastly, their customer service is a nightmare. They will put you on hold for hours, clearly hoping you will tire and hang up.

"I would rate this company 0 if i could - SHOCKING experience leaving me with almost 500 GBP being stolen. This company website did not work the several times i tried to book, claimed that my booking had not gone through, and that payment was not authorised and not taken. So after many attempts i booked flights directly with the airline. I then noticed that GotoGate had in fact taken full payment, despite informing me that payment was not authorised and the booking had not gone through. Called their customer service within an hour of the funds being taken, to which they initially tried to claim that due to time zones 24 hours had passed and i could not cancel the flights (which i had never actually booked according to their website). This was ludicrous as clearly it had only been an hour since trying to book / funds being taken without authorisation.They then eventually agreed to cancel the flights, however wanted to take a 70 GBP ""handling fee"" - despite the fact this is not a cancellation its clearly money being taken for a service not provided.The customer service team kept trying to trick me into confirming that i had a contract and was therefore cancelling, and eventally hung up on me and would not agree to escalate to a manager. Incredibly deceptive practices. I have thoroughly read their T&C's, and if booking via the UK / EU then there is protection via the European Comission. If any other customers face the same issues with this company (im sure they will!) then please please please follow up, contact your credit card if you have protection on that side, and contact dispute resolution services.

I was fortunate enough to be able to booked a premium plus seat (very front of the plane) from Air Transat using GoToGate in August 2023 from Ft Lauderdale to Toronto. I had booked the wrong date however these seats allow for free flight info changes. Now I did book the wrong date and that's on me but I tried reaching out the day of the flight and by the time I was able to get ahold of someone the flight had departed and then I was told there was nothing that they could do. I normally get email notifications of flights departing and when to arrive etc. I didn't get any in this case. I only realized once I was confirming the flight with my ride that it was for that day (a few days before I actually intended to leave). My biggest issue is that GoToGate said they couldn't do anything I would have to reach out to Air transat and Air Transat said I would have to reach out to GoToGate because I bought the ticket through them. My advice buy the ticket directly from the airline. Biggest headache is when both companies lay you off to the other one to avoid having to help in any way.,1,Negative,fortunate enough able book premium plus seat front plane air transat use gotogate august ft lauderdale toronto book wrong date however seat allow free flight info change book wrong date that s try reach day flight time able get ahold someone flight depart tell nothing could normally get email notification flight depart arrive etc do not get case realize confirm flight ride day day actually intend leave big issue gotogate say could not anything would reach air transat air transat say would reach gotogate buy ticket advice buy ticket directly airline big headache company lie one avoid help way

"1. I booked the ticket with Gotogate and the air company decided to move my flight by 5 hours. I learned about it from my friends, who were taking the same flight and thankfully used another service. I never got a notification from Gotogate even when I notified them about this fact.2. Customer support is very lacking. The company doesn't list an email anywhere. The only options are chat and phone calls. I waited for 3 hours to get support on Sunday.3. Hell started when I wanted to get a refund. The company doesn't have or provide any timelines. When I finally got some timeline, it was 5 working days for an air company to respond to their request. Well two weeks later and 4 attempts to contact customer support later, no updates were provided to me other than ""our team is working on it"" and I don't think it's even true. My friends got their refunds from other agencies in one week.I had to file a CC dispute with my bank and I missed the time window to book alternative tickets for a good price.

"Subject: Complaint Regarding Denied Transit Visa and Poor Customer ServiceDear GO TO GATE,I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with my recent experience booking a flight through your service. I booked a flight India to Auckland [ order no 1014-296-049, issued on 26/05/2024, Booking Number NFKLVT] that included a transit visa for [mention country]. Unfortunately, I did not receive the transit visa before my travel date.Throughout the waiting period, I attempted to contact your customer service agents numerous times through your chat service.  Unfortunately, my experience was very frustrating. I faced several issues:Unresponsive Chat Service: I had to wait a significant amount of time for each response from the chat agents.Incorrect Contact Information: When I requested a phone number to discuss my situation further, the agents provided incorrect numbers that did not connect.Lack of Solutions: The chat agents were unable to offer any solutions to my problem and kept me waiting for extended periods, after which the chat would disconnect. I then had to repeat the entire process again.Despite promptly providing all the required documentation for the transit visa within the specified timeframe, I received no response from GO TO GATE until after the deadline had passed.  At that point, I was informed that my case had been closed due to a lack of response on my part, which was entirely untrue.This entire experience has been incredibly frustrating and unacceptable.  The lack of communication, incorrect information provided by your agents, and the unresponsiveness to my situation demonstrate a severe lack of customer service on GO TO GATE's part.I request that you investigate this matter thoroughly and provide me with a solution.  This could include rebooking my flight with the transit visa included, or a full refund for the original booking.I will provide all the relevant documentation related to my transit visa application and communication attempts with your customer service agents.Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

"I recently had an incredibly disappointing experience with GoToGate that has left me questioning their commitment to customer service and environmental responsibility. My situation involved a simple request to change an itinerary for a WestJet flight, aiming to reduce unnecessary travel and carbon emissions.Lack of CooperationDespite my attempts to coordinate with the airline WestJet directly, I was told that changes to my booking must be made through GoToGate. When I reached out to GoToGate via their web chat, I was met with an absolute lack of cooperation. The agent informed me that they could not make any changes, effectively passing the responsibility back to WestJet. This back-and-forth left me in a frustrating loop with no resolution in sight.Negative Customer ExperienceThe handling of my request has resulted in a profoundly negative customer experience. My simple request to cancel the first leg of my trip from Vancouver to Calgary without any interest in recompense was not only dismissed but has also created unnecessary worry about the safety and convenience of my overall trip. This inflexibility is unacceptable for a company in the travel industry.Environmental ConcernsWhat’s even more alarming is the disregard for environmental impact. This situation forces me to fly from Calgary back to Vancouver just to board a flight to Calgary again. Leaving me in this situation, GoToGate is indirectly contributing to over 109 kg of additional CO2 emissions. This unnecessary pollution is entirely avoidable and contrary to the efforts we should all be making to protect our planet.Poor Customer ServiceAdding to the frustration, there have been times when I was placed in a web chat queue with over 300 other people. I spent hours waiting to speak with someone, only to receive unhelpful responses. This inefficient system only compounds the stress and disappointment of dealing with GoToGate.Still Time to ActThe flights in question are not until the 24th of July, and I have raised a formal complaint with GoToGate urging them to collaborate with WestJet to resolve this issue for me as their customer. There is still ample time for them to act and resolve this matter, yet so far, I have seen no effort on their part to do so.Overall, my experience with GoToGate has been extremely disappointing. Their lack of cooperation, poor customer service, and disregard for environmental concerns have left me deeply dissatisfied. I urge others to consider these issues when booking through GoToGate and hope the company takes immediate steps to improve their services and policies.---To update this, a few days later, I spoke with the WestJet Management team in person about this matter. The Management team also consulted with the WestJet internal resolution team, who handle ticketing. They showed compassion and genuinely wanted to help, but ultimately could not. Both teams concluded that the flight leg cancellation can only be done by GoToGate, the third-party booking agent. Unfortunately, GoToGate remains uncooperative.As a result, I am stuck having to unnecessarily buy another airline ticket and take three flights instead of one to return home, all because I booked through GoToGate instead of directly with the airline. Ask yourself if you're okay with this risk before deciding whether to use them.If not, book directly with the airline.",1,Negative,recently incredibly disappointing experience gotogate leave question commitment customer service environmental responsibility situation involve simple request change itinerary westjet flight aiming reduce unnecessary travel carbon emissionslack cooperationdespite attempt coordinate airline westjet directly tell change booking must make gotogate reach gotogate via web chat meet absolute lack cooperation agent inform could make change effectively pass responsibility back westjet backandforth leave frustrating loop resolution sightnegative customer experiencethe handling request result profoundly negative customer experience simple request cancel first leg trip vancouver calgary without interest recompense dismiss also create unnecessary worry safety convenience overall trip inflexibility unacceptable company travel industryenvironmental concernswhat even alarm disregard environmental impact situation force fly calgary back vancouver board flight calgary leave situation gotogate indirectly contribute kg additional co emission unnecessary pollution entirely avoidable contrary effort make protect planetpoor customer serviceadde frustration time place web chat queue people spend hour waiting speak someone receive unhelpful response inefficient system compound stress disappointment deal gotogatestill time actthe flight question th july raise formal complaint gotogate urging collaborate westjet resolve issue customer still ample time act resolve matter yet far see effort part sooverall experience gotogate extremely disappointing lack cooperation poor customer service disregard environmental concern leave deeply dissatisfied urge other consider issue book gotogate hope company take immediate step improve service policiesto update day later speak westjet management team person matter management team also consult westjet internal resolution team handle ticketing show compassion genuinely want help ultimately could team conclude flight leg cancellation do gotogate thirdparty book agent unfortunately gotogate remain uncooperativea result stuck unnecessarily buy another airline ticket take three flight instead one return home book gotogate instead directly airline ask you re okay risk decide whether use themif book directly airline

"Update:October 6: zero feedback from Gotogate.July 31: updating this review with the latest timeline. No news from Gotogate.Next update will be if they ever reply. Until then they’ll keep their on-star review.July 29: sent receipts to Gotogate for the checked-in suitcase.July 28: flight to YYC OK. Still no news.July 24: flight to LAX OK.We were nice and took only one suitcase for the 4 of us although it was a bit tight… and because we don’t know if we can trust them to actually pay for it.No news from Gotogate.July 22: replied to their email to let them know that we will be checking in a suitcase as we are not allowed to have carry-on even if we want to pay for it.Asked them to confirm they will indeed refund the extra cost and not only try to provide for the refund.July 21: received an email from GotogateI received a mail yesterday (July 22 - our flight is on Jul 24) from Gotogate telling me that we if WestJet don’t let us fly with a carry on, then to pay for the extra cost and keep the receipts, and then they « will be trying to provide for the refund ».I am therefore waiting to see how hard they will try to provide for the refund and will update my review and the rating accordingly.July 12: Gotogate replied to my review (see below)———————————Avoid them at all costs.Booked a flight from Calgary to Los Angeles with WestJet through gotogate.com for July 2024.We specifically chose tickets with carry-on luggage.We had 2 issues:1- My 4 year-old son was registered as Master xxx and as an adult.

Nothing was modified for my son, despite them saying he had been switched to child.As for the carry-on baggage, one same person told me in the same conversation that they were not included, and then 16 minutes later after I insisted she said that they were included.When I asked her to confirm they were indeed included she just simply closed the chat.My understanding is that they just don't do anything and don't want to deal with any issue after you've paid for your tickets.

"Gotogate made the booking with the airline with the wrong personal details (including booking one of the passengers - a child - as an adult) and failed to book the extra checked baggage for which I paid. When I contacted customer support via chat (the only contact method available, obviously), and after finally getting past the automated assistant, the person on the other side proved completely useless. They started by responding to my request for assistance with personal details from other customers, apologizing that that message was not for me and after that asking for 5 minutes to review my situation. After this, they sent a message saying that due to technical difficulties, they would not be able to resolve the issue and to try contacting them again later. After 'trying again later', a different customer support agent, reassured me that everything had been resolved. I then went back to the airline to check and surprise, surprise - nothing had been. Based on this experience, I can only recommend others stay away. Next time I need to make a booking, I most definitely will.",1,Negative,gotogate make book airline wrong personal detail include book one passenger child adult fail book extra check baggage pay contact customer support via chat contact method available obviously finally get past automate assistant person side prove completely useless start respond request assistance personal detail customer apologize message ask minute review situation send message say due technical difficulty would able resolve issue try contact later try later different customer support agent reassure everything resolve go back airline check surprise surprise nothing base experience recommend other stay away next time need make booking definitely
"I recently booked my travel tickets through Gotogate, and I regret to say that my experience has been profoundly disappointing. Just one day after my booking, I received a notification that my tickets had been cancelled due to technical issues. This abrupt cancellation has had a severely negative impact on my family and me, disrupting our meticulously planned trip.We had organised our travel itinerary with great care, and this cancellation not only derailed our plans but also caused significant distress, especially to my two children. The emotional toll of having our holiday plans suddenly fall apart is immense, and it has greatly affected our spirits.Moreover, the cost of our tickets was approximately £3,000, a substantial amount that has yet to be refunded to my account. This financial uncertainty is incredibly stressful, as I am now unable to book alternative tickets. With prices fluctuating constantly, I am deeply concerned about whether I will be able to afford to rebook our flights at a reasonable rate.The lack of prompt refund and the inconvenience caused by this situation have left me utterly dissatisfied with Gotogate's services. The failure to deliver on their commitment and the subsequent impact on my family's well-being is unacceptable. I find it difficult to recommend this company to others based on my experience.Gotogate's handling of this matter has been far from satisfactory, and I hope this review serves as a caution to potential customers. My hope is that Gotogate improves their service and customer care to prevent such distressing incidents from occurring in the future.",1,Negative,recently book travel ticket gotogate regret say experience profoundly disappointing one day booking receive notification ticket cancel due technical issue abrupt cancellation severely negative impact family disrupt meticulously plan tripwe organise travel itinerary great care cancellation derail plan also cause significant distress especially two child emotional toll holiday plan suddenly fall apart immense greatly affected spiritsmoreover cost ticket approximately substantial amount yet refund account financial uncertainty incredibly stressful unable book alternative ticket price fluctuate constantly deeply concerned whether able afford rebook flight reasonable ratethe lack prompt refund inconvenience cause situation leave utterly dissatisfied gotogate service failure deliver commitment subsequent impact family wellbee unacceptable find difficult recommend company other base experiencegotogate handle matter far satisfactory hope review serve caution potential customer hope gotogate improve service customer care prevent distressing incident occur future

Talking to them is a waste of time.

I booked a ticket tried to change it a week in advance to a different date and was told that was fine they will get in touch when they find the next available date. I was contacted with a new date and to pay the difference of ticket and booking fee which I was happy to do and did. Once I paid that, they then sent me another link 10mins after to make another payment the same price as my original ticket to get another ticket which was ridiculous. I have been trying to understand and get a reasoning as to why I am being asked to pay nearly another £1,000 to change my ticket but they don’t have a valid reason why. I have been trying to get this sorted for nearly two weeks but no luck. Every time I ask to speak to a manager they keep putting me on hold or try to say call back in half an hour and when I do they put me on hold. I don’t understand why I paid for a ticket plus additional charges to change it but then get told to pay again for another amount which is more than the original price I paid for the first ticket make it make sense which they could not explain. I am in constant battle just to change my flight to a later date. They are unprofessional and do not know what they’re talking about. They keep saying they’ll sort it out but they never do.

"Avoid them at all costs. They are scammers. I booked a flexible ticket with them, nearly costing me 3,500 USD. Then I canceled it, and they only refunded 90% of the ticket value, but the catch is they refunded it via a voucher. Later on, I wanted to use the voucher to book another trip, which was a cheap one. I was planning to use the voucher multiple times. So I applied 10% of the value of the voucher and then wanted to use it again, but it was impossible. I later found in their terms and conditions that you can only use the voucher once. This was not made clear at all, contrary to what you find in my vouchers that can be used multiple times. I requested to get my money back from their support, and they declined my request. So basically, I lost 3,000 USD in a second to these thieves. Please avoid them. They are scammers and thieves.Updates: I just read their response. If this company was serious about fixing the problem of stealing my money, they would have offered to put back the money in the voucher, which they didn't.

However, a few hours later, I received an email stating that due to technical reasons, the booking was canceled and the amount would be refunded within 3-5 working days.This is absolutely ridiculous as the flight is supposed to take off in just two days!

Furthermore, ticket prices have increased significantly as the departure date approaches, adding to my financial burden.To make matters worse, GoToGate’s customer support has been completely unhelpful and useless.

"Do not ever use Go To Gate! I am a very experienced traveller (work and leisure) and they have comfortably given me the worst experience in my life. They owe me £1,800 and have not refunded this money since Janaury - applaling and has put me in a precarious financial position. My flight was cancelled by the airline at short notice in January, shortly after booking. As GTG are an agent, they request monies back from the airline first before remitting refunds. I know this industry and I know that often, agents will either not remit funds to the airline or the ariline holds it in a restricted account until the flight has completed. I had to coordinate both the airline and GTG to ask about who had contacted who re: refunds. GTG constantly said they had asked the airline. The airline consistently said they had not heard anything. After 2 months of waiting, I raised a chargeback via my credit card. The chargeback was denied as GTG had said the service was provided! The flight was cancelled! I was then told I had to wait for the chargeback to lapse before they would refund which was 12th June. Since then I have repeatedly called to which I am told  that the refund is coming, 5 business days... I keep waiting, I call back and now I am told the airline still has the money! It's 5 months ago! I am told they have to follow policy, however, as your customer you have not once called me back or e-mailed me, nor have you offered any compensation nor have you even tried to resolve it. You could just pay me from your bank account, but you won't as it's not ""policy"".As an experienced traveller, you will never have my money again.

Only that after some time they came back telling me actually ‘having checked with airline’ I’m not entitled for a refund (1st time excuse), and later on - my ticket has been used, even though I have obviously never took that flight let alone been in that country at the time.

"I had an absolutely horrendous experience with Gotogate and Booking.com regarding my flight reservation with ticket number SG55CP, scheduled for June 14, 2023. When faced with a genuine emergency necessitating a ticket change, their customer service, particularly their call centre in India, proved to be completely incompetent, clueless, and lacking in both communication skills and language proficiency.Despite repeated assurances and providing a payment link, they disappeared for weeks, leaving me stranded without a resolution or refund. This blatant disregard for customer needs and their deceptive practices are appalling.I strongly advise everyone to steer clear of Gotogate and Booking.com. They operate like a scam, showing no regard for customer satisfaction or basic ethics. It's clear they care more about pocketing money than providing legitimate service. The call centre in India should be shut down immediately, as they contribute to the overall incompetence and frustration experienced by customers.Businesses like Gotogate and Booking.com should not be allowed to operate, and I will actively encourage others to boycott them until they face consequences for their illegal practices.",1,Negative,absolutely horrendous experience gotogate bookingcom regard flight reservation ticket number sgcp schedule june face genuine emergency necessitating ticket change customer service particularly call centre india prove completely incompetent clueless lack communication skill language proficiencydespite repeat assurance provide payment link disappear week leave strand without resolution refund blatant disregard customer need deceptive practice appallingi strongly advise everyone steer clear gotogate bookingcom operate like scam show regard customer satisfaction basic ethic clear care pocket money provide legitimate service call centre india shut immediately contribute overall incompetence frustration experience customersbusinesse like gotogate bookingcom allow operate actively encourage other boycott face consequence illegal practice

I called Go To Gate to tell them that my flight was cancelled and I didn't even received an email letting me know that thank God I checked and called the airline directly their response was that the airline didn't send them no email saying it was cancelled they checked everything and exactly my flight was cancelled their response was that they were going to try again to rebook the flight if no luck they would refund me. The next day I woke up to an email from them saying that unfortunately my flight has been cancelled by the airline due to technical issues and they will refund my money in 5 business day.

"I wish I knew how to give this company zero stars.  They have lied to me for over five months about a refund they were supposed to be processing for a canceled flight in January.

"This company has the worst customer service ever.I have booked a flight last year that I had to cancel (with more than 2 months of notice, so it was not last minute). Obviously, they did not refund me money but they provided a voucher which was worth 90% of the final price of the ticket. Cool, right? Yes. Expect that the voucher never worked. They sent me this voucher on June 2023 and I have tried to book a flight using the voucher since December 2023. I have tried multiple times, and there was always something wrong. They even cancelled the first voucher and provided a new one. Same story: everytime that I was on the booking page, the voucher wouldn't be applicable. I have contacted the customer service countless times and their answer was always: ""Just go on the website and book the flight without adding anyting else."" and I'm like: ""Well, this is what I've been trying to do for the past few months aren't I""Then, the day before the expiry date of the voucher (so one year later) it seemed that the voucher worked! So I booked a flight, added the voucher in the space, proceeded to check out...but the voucher was not accepted. However, they did charge me anyway for the full price of the flight! So not only I've lost 200 euros worth of voucher, I got also charged 160 euros for the other flight! And when I pointed this out to the customer service and asking to have a refund at least for the second flight that I got unfairly charged for, their answer was: "" We apologise for any inconvenience. However it is not possible to have a refund."" Looked (and still does look) like a scam to me.Now I'm also in the process of postponing another flight that I have (unwisely) booked with them again. And I booked a flexible ticket just to be able to change the date without having to pay extra penalties.Unfortunately, getting in contact with the customer service is the most complicated thing ever: they either send you ""no-reply emails"" or they suggest you to use the live chat in their website in which you either have to deal with an IA or if you are lucky, after a really long wait, are put in contact with an agent who's usually completely helpless and just redirects you somewhere else. I just have to hope that I will not lose more money this time again.Bottom line is: the web is plenty with online travel agencies and cheap flights websites. You'd better book yours somewhere else and stay away from this one.",1,Negative,company bad customer service everi book flight last year cancel month notice last minute obviously refund money provide voucher worth final price ticket cool right yes expect voucher never work send voucher june try book flight use voucher since december try multiple time always something wrong even cancel first voucher provide new one story everytime booking page voucher would not applicable contact customer service countless time answer always go website book flight without add anyte else I m like well I ve try past month be not ithen day expiry date voucher one year later seem voucher work book flight add voucher space proceed check outbut voucher accept however charge anyway full price flight I ve lose euro worth voucher get also charge euros flight point customer service ask refund least second flight get unfairly charge answer apologise inconvenience however possible refund look still look like scam menow I m also process postpone another flight unwisely book book flexible ticket able change date without pay extra penaltiesunfortunately get contact customer service complicate thing ever either send noreply email suggest use live chat website either deal ia lucky really long wait put contact agent who s usually completely helpless redirect somewhere else hope lose money time againbottom line web plenty online travel agency cheap flight website you d well book somewhere else stay away one

After reviewing the cancellation with JetBlue I was instructed to contact Booking.com with whom I had purchased the ticket through.The Booking.com team instructed me on that day that I would not have to process any request and that once they received confirmation of cancellation by JetBlue they would proceed to a refund.It has come to my surprise that Booking.com had instructed me that the JetBlue team did not cancel my flight and you could not proceed to a refund. After speaking to JetBlue, I was instructed that a note of cancellation was added for the Booking.com team visibility, identifying that, due to JetBlue’s fault, the flight had been cancelled.I am now in the process of receiving the proof of this message with them.

"I booked flights to Vietnam through GotoGate. We're suppose to leave in a week. The flights will be operated by 3 different carriers.

I did go for the option to rebook and were now Friday and I'm  still waiting for the rebooking. But because of the rebooking (which may or may noy happen) we will be entering Vietnam in a different airport so we need new visa's and the clock is ticking.

I can see the flights in all 3 apps and in the GotoGate app. GotoGate doesn't give an explanation for this.I have no idea which visa we'll be needing, at what time we need to be at the airport and which flight route we will be taking if any... Just to say: I need clarification NOW and they're not giving it to me. Update: After calling and mailing again and again someone at Go To Gate finally figured out what had happened: our flights were never cancelled (even if I got a mail saying they were) but due to a change of the second leg of the journey the tranist to part 3 was too close. So now we just changed the last flight by half an hour and we should be fine.

I experienced these also.I had a flight booked from Geneva to Vancouver in Premium Economy in May 23. Gotogate downgraded me to economy. I have spent the last 13 months trying to get a refund for the difference. The staff are liars. ""I will resolve this for you"", they don't. ""I will call you back"", they don't. Every call ends in ""I have referred this to my back office team"" - I am not sure a team exists as there is no resolution. Eventually they tried a low ball offer, which, when I called them out on it, they blamed on currency conversion. Seeing as neither £, $, € or CHF are a factor of 4 from either other, I think this is another lie. They made another offer, which they reneged on. They refuse to share their workings over the fare difference. Unless you want to travel in a lower class than you paid for, and spend 13 months trying to resolve, I would recommend against booking with gotogate.

"When I wanted to make changes to my flight booked through Booking.com, I was referred to Gotogate, which works in cooperation with Booking.com. When calling the Gotogate hotline, I was immediately offered the 'fare difference' for the change—over 2000 euros.After I pointed out that online the new flight was actually cheaper than the previous purchase price and that I actually had expected a refund, I was told that unfortunately, that is the price, 'calculated by the system.' There was nothing they could do. I was advised to try the change again later, as prices change frequently.On a later attempt, they again offered a hefty additional charge, even though the price for the same ticket had dropped online.After my second attempt and refusal to go ahead, I found the booking code issued by the airline in my emails (not to be confused with the booking number of Gotogate). With the airline booking code, I was able to manage the flight booking directly with United. And see... the change was at least free. For me, it is clear: UNFAIR PRICE CHARGES FOR FLIGHT CHANGES.

"Whatever you do never book with goto gate they are scammers. We are being also victims of Go to gate scams. Booked a flight on Emirates and Bangkok airways to Samui with gotogate. They got my name wrong and put my name first as first and last name, I have 2 first names, not an unusual thing i guess. So that was the first scam. When we noticed it we try to call, number doesn't work, we went on the chat and they said we needed to call the airline. Emirates says that obviously because the ticket is booked with a agency they can't do it. So after 5 days of online chats and endless calls with emirates, emirates mentioned they would allowed the name change without a problem, and they sent goto gate a SSR on the booking which is a special request to allow the change. Gotogate called and they charged 160 AED for a name change even thought it was their F****up. Now one day from my flght and after charging me for a name change they say they can't do it and that Emirates is not allowing it which is a blatant lie.   This is possibly the worst OTA I have ever came across in my life and I am in the tourism and airline sector for 30 years.

"Copy of the email I sent to their CEO and customer service reps:I hope this email finds you well. I would like the following issue to be brought to your attention. The gotogate website charged me twice for the same flight. I called EasyJet airlines and they checked everything and issued a full refund. But gotogate charged me $90 to cancel the reservation for 2 people and to to issue a refund. Even though the website charged me twice I still had to pay for cancellation. Unfair. Our family of 5 travels to Europe every summer, this summer we have about 20 flights multiplied by 5 people is 100 tickets and I will male sure I don’t use gotogate for any of them.

"I am very disappointed with the service from this company. I've booked with them for many years and when you have no issues, you're fine; but if you have issues, it will be an issue. On March 12, 2024, I attempted to book a flight for two people to Berlin. Due to a payment error on their website, I ended up with two bookings within minutes and was charged twice. Unfortunately, I did not screenshot their error message. Despite immediate contact with customer service, who acknowledged the issue and assured a cancellation of the first booking and a refund, I only received a partial refund. CHF 80 was not refunded, supposedly due to the airline.Key issues:1. Their website allowed a second booking despite a payment error.2. I received a partial refund, which implicitly acknowledges their fault.3. I did not book the same flight twice on purpose. Who on earth would do that. The double booking happened due to a technical error on their end.4. I should not bear the cost of their technical issues.I have quite politely (!) contacted their customer service three times via email with no response, asking for a statement as to why I, as a customer, have to pay for their technical issues.

"Yesterday experienced terrible service. Was given the best price via Kayak and then proceed to book a multi-city trip with Emirates. After submitting credit card details, a 'Payment Error' was given. I spoke to Customer Services who said that I should wait 2 hours and call back if no confirmation email was received and also I should check my card company to see if money had been deducted. This I did and on the second call it was confirmed the transaction timed out. So 2 hours wasted while the prices kept increasing. They said try again (with a different browser) which I did with resulting in the same effect. After waiting another 2 or 3 hours I spoke to them who repeated what was said previously. They also said it COULD BE one of THREE ISSUES : 1) 'The prices have changed', 2) 'a card company issue', 3) 'a connection issue' with the airline. BUT the point is that THEY COULD NOT advise what it could be. This means their systems do not have the simple ability to provide an audit trail to help identify what the problem is and therefore what to change the next time. In fact when trying to find my transaction they requested personal information PLUS THE TOTAL COST OF THE PACKAGE, which I did not originally note down. They then identified the transaction via a different method which was more inconvenient to them. How is the customer supposed to know that if there is an issue they will need the total cost, and in fact why does is this required when passenger name and other details are available ??? The people are trying to be helpful BUT their system is NOT CUSTOMER FOCUSSED.

"On June 9, 2023, I purchased flights for myself and my children from Osaka to Rome through the gotogate.it website (airline: China Eastern), with a departure date of July 22, 2023. On July 8, 2023, my father suddenly passed away, and I had to return to Italy early. As a result, I had to cancel my flight and purchase a new one departing as soon as possible. Therefore, I needed a refund, if not full, at least partial, for my flight.Gotogate assistance informed me that, given the circumstances, I can request a full or nearly full refund. I provided Gotogate with my father's death certificate in English as requested, and they told me to wait for the airline to process the refund.I contacted Gotogate several times via their website chat and by phone, and they told me that they had not yet heard from the airline. On November 9, 2023, I personally contacted the airline, and they told me they had not received any refund request from Gotogate (the request most be submitted through the BSP system). I immediately informed Gotogate of this, and they said they would take care of it. On November 29, 2023, I contacted the airline again, and they still had not received anything. So, on the same day, I sent an email to Gotogate support, urging them to submit the request to the airline and process the refund as soon as possible. Also, on the same day, I contacted Gotogate via their chat, explaining the issue and asking for proof that they had submitted the request to the airline, but they said they couldn't provide it and would send it as soon as possible. They also responded to the email asking for more time.At this point, I decided to give them time, but nothing has been done after six months. The airline even contacted me to inform me that the ticket was about to expire for any changes and purchases. Additionally, the booking has been canceled on the Gotogate website.I have all the proof with email and chat.It is better to buy tickets directly from the airlines even if they cost a bit more.

Booked an Emirates flight to the UK on the CheattoGate website because it was (marginally) cheaper than booking via Emirates direct. Spent what seemed like forever declining extras such as insurance, seat choices and sms alerts etc but right at the end I  didn’t notice they had cleverly slipped in AED195 for credit card fees which made the flight more expensive than booking with Emirates! I called them to say I’ve never been charged fees by my card provider (HSBC) with the response (in very broken English) “ not us, charge by bank, speak them” I knew this was rubbish but spoke to HSBC anyway who of course confirmed they don’t charge fees.I contacted cheat to gate and they said the same thing….pretty sad to need to be dishonest to scam an extra AED195, times must be tough!

"Horrible Experience - Canceled Flight and No RefundI booked a flight with Gotogate for September 12, 2023, with confirmation code NSSVAY. Unfortunately, the flight was canceled, and despite multiple attempts to get a refund, I have received nothing.Gotogate's customer service has been extremely unprofessional and abusive. I have call recordings where their representatives use foul language and treat customers with blatant disrespect. Their customer service appears to be based in India, and every time I call, I am met with rude behavior and empty promises that they are ""looking into it"" and ""investigating"" the issue. It's now been almost seven months, and I have yet to see any resolution or refund.This company is a complete scam. They take your money and provide no service, and then refuse to refund you when things go wrong. Their treatment of customers is appalling and unacceptable. I urge everyone to avoid Gotogate at all costs. They should not be allowed to operate with such unethical and deceitful practices.I will be sharing my experience across all social media platforms to warn others about this scam company.

"Book directly with the airlineSeriously, it's not worth the small fare difference. If you need to change anything, you can't change directly with the airline. You need to go through them. Which is a big pain and not transparent at all. I was asked to pay 229 GBP to change my flight, which I did (including a 35 GBP service fee for their chat person). Then they told me they had not quoted for 'taxes' and the amount had to double. Why would an airline booking change fee have 100% taxes applied to it? I have no idea, and neither did they. They wouldn't say this though. Just kept repeating the same lines and not giving me any information.

I actually did not even want to cancel it, I wanted to change the origin, but they couldn't do that for me due to some other non sense policy of theirs, so the only option I had was to cancel (and lose the cost of the fee) and rebook the flight I wanted (paying their fee again).

If this stupid company could get negative 1000s stars from me they definitley would. The worst booking experience I ever had booking a plane ticket through a third party and their customer service  reps are a  bunch of useless imbeciles. I booked a flight through them  for $418 dollars at $140 per ticket for three people.I realized right after I book it that one of the names on the reservation was incorrect  and I saw no way to change it without being charged more money  so I cancled the flight figuring I was safe because  it was within the free 24 hour cancellation window most airlines give. I cancled and rebooked the flight using the same service and change the name that needed to be corrected. I recieved a confirmation email from the airline my cancellation went through but not through gotogate  so I called to confirm that my flight was canceled/ I would be refunded. Their reps inform me that they can cancel my flight buut I will be charged a $132 dollar cancellation fee for cancelling my tickets even though even though I rebooked them immediately after I cancelled them through their own website.

There was a flight for exactly the same price without the layover. This was what I intended to book. There is no way to change this error without paying at a minimum £70 - cancellation handling fee.

"(Edit after gotogate replied to my review): no, in fact I will share how incredibly unprofessional gotogate is to anyone who is trying to use your services. I already had my expectation for the level of the service before it got obliterated by your support in this matter and ignorance in the reply, and BEFORE you guys charged me for the flight that I couldn’t even go to. The reply was incredibly dismissive and doesn’t return my $304 for the service that was not provided. I’ll change my review after my $304 (that I couldn't use) will be refunded in full to my bank account. Gotogate is an absolute waste of a company.I attempted to book tickets through Gotogate due to their competitive pricing and the appropriate tickets for the layovers we needed. However, the booking process was problematic. They issued two separate tickets, as two different (unrelated) trips to each other, instead of a two-planes for one trip. During the process with the first ticket the website was completely unresponsive after completing the fields of information correctly, and after buying the first ticket, we tried to secure the second ticket with the correct layover was unavailable, rendering the first ticket useless and costing us $300. They then denied our claim for a refund, asserting they had provided the necessary service, despite effectively scamming us with a ticket that lacked a connecting flight to our destination.",1,Negative,edit gotogate reply review fact share incredibly unprofessional gotogate anyone try use service already expectation level service get obliterate support matter ignorance reply guy charge flight could not even go reply incredibly dismissive do not return service provide ill change review could not use refunded full bank account gotogate absolute waste companyi attempt book ticket gotogate due competitive pricing appropriate ticket layover need however booking process problematic issue two separate ticket two different unrelated trip instead twoplane one trip process first ticket website completely unresponsive completing field information correctly buy first ticket try secure second ticket correct layover unavailable render first ticket useless cost we deny claim refund assert provide necessary service despite effectively scamme we ticket lack connect flight destination

Also, they had not booked our seats so we were randomly placed around the airplane. One of our party needed extra legroom that they had paid for. The same happened on the return journey. They told us to get in touch with the airline and they said they cannot help because it was booked through GoToGate. I will never be using this company again and will go direct through the airline.

"This case has been utterly unacceptable. Never have I experienced such poor customer service and a company that deliberately tries to hustle its customers.Brief Background:I was denied boarding my flight as the airline informed me that, due to some new visa regulations in China, I could not board. However, the airline assured me that I was entitled to a full refund. When I contacted Flybillet (owned by GoToGate) for the first time, I was told that there was nothing Flybillet could do, as it was related to visa regulations. I informed them that the airline had told me I was entitled to a refund from the airline. Despite this, Flybillet denied that they could do anything. As this did not align with the information from the airline, I called back and demanded they investigate the matter further. After 45 minutes of back-and-forth, during which they repeatedly tried to offer me a cancellation that would only refund 90 EUR of my 500 EUR, they agreed to investigate further, but only if I got the airline to state in writing that they would speak with Flybillet.I contacted the airline, which said that since Flybillet had purchased the ticket, they could only discuss the matter with the ticket purchaser. However, the airline informed me that they had made a note on my e-ticket stating that I was entitled to full compensation. I called Flybillet back and relayed this information, and they said they would proceed with it.After a month, Flybillet called back to inform me that they would not be able to refund my ticket and could only offer me the 90 EUR remaining after canceling the ticket, claiming the airline would not permit the refund. I refused to accept this, as I had received confirmation from the airline that I was entitled to a refund. It did not appear that they had contacted the airline, so I asked them to contact the airline again and provide me with a written rejection. This resulted in Flybillet contacting me after 5 weeks with information that the airline had approved a full refund of 500 EUR, as they had stated all along.One can therefore conclude that Flybillet repeatedly tried to cheat me out of my money, misinform me, avoid paying what was rightfully mine, and failed to do their job. Never have I experienced anything like this. So if you ever find yourself in the same situation, do not let Flybillet deceive you. Keep fighting. Now, it is just a matter of waiting to see if I receive my money...",1,Negative,case utterly unacceptable never experience poor customer service company deliberately try hustle customersbrief backgroundi deny boarding flight airline inform due new visa regulation china could board however airline assure entitle full refund contact flybillet own gotogate first time tell nothing flybillet could relate visa regulation inform airline tell entitle refund airline despite flybillet deny could anything align information airline call back demand investigate matter minute backandforth repeatedly try offer cancellation would refund eur eur agree investigate get airline state writing would speak flybilleti contact airline say since flybillet purchase ticket could discuss matter ticket purchaser however airline inform make note eticket state entitle full compensation call flybillet back relay information say would proceed itafter month flybillet call back inform would able refund ticket could offer eur remain cancel ticket claim airline would permit refund refuse accept receive confirmation airline entitle refund appear contact airline ask contact airline provide write rejection result flybillet contact week information airline approve full refund eur state alongone therefore conclude flybillet repeatedly try cheat money misinform avoid pay rightfully mine fail job never experience anything like ever find situation let flybillet deceive keep fight matter wait see receive money

"We booked two tickets Barcelona - Osaka, with layover in Shenzhen for 1500€ approximately on Apr 11th via Gotogate. On April 28th, Shenzhen Airlines cancelled one of our flights, so we contacted GotoGate. Initially, Gotogate said it was only a change of flight number, and that everything was okay. After further investigation, they saw the flight Shenzhen-Osaka was cancelled. They offered us an alternative, which was not suitable (an extra layover and several hours delay). Since we refused it, they mentioned we could ask for a refund. For more than month, they have said that they are waiting for the airline to approve the refund, and every time we ask about the status they still say this is only a change of flight number. After we insist, they verify the flight is cancelled.We decided to contact the airline ourselves, and we finally got the confirmation from the airline that the flight can be refunded, but it should be Gotogate to return us the money.Still no news from Gotogate and of course our money is still held by them. We are very disappointed with their support team, there seems to be a lot of lack of internal communication and transparency, we just want our money back.The reference code 1004-043-012",1,Negative,book two ticket barcelona osaka layover shenzhen approximately apr th via gotogate april th shenzhen airlines cancel one flight contact gotogate initially gotogate say change flight number everything okay investigation see flight shenzhenosaka cancel offer we alternative suitable extra layover several hour delay since refuse mention could ask refund month say wait airline approve refund every time ask status still say change flight number insist verify flight cancelledwe decide contact airline finally get confirmation airline flight refunded gotogate return we moneystill news gotogate course money still hold disappointed support team seem lot lack internal communication transparency want money backthe reference code

"Title: Gotogate Refuses to Return Money for Canceled Air TicketDescription:I recently canceled my flight with Gotogate due to unforeseen circumstances, expecting a refund within the promised 5 business days. Despite following their cancellation process and receiving confirmation, I have not received my money back. Here's a summary of the issues:Extended Waiting Period: After the specified 5 business days passed, no refund was credited to my account. Even after waiting an additional week, there was still no sign of the refund.Customer Service Challenges: Contacting Gotogate's customer service has been a nightmare. Long hold times, dropped calls, and vague responses from representatives have made it impossible to get a clear status update on my refund.Conflicting Information: Different representatives provided conflicting information about the refund status, adding to my frustration and confusion.Escalation Attempts: Attempts to escalate the issue to a supervisor or manager were ignored or denied, leaving me without any effective resolution.Financial Impact: The missing refund has caused significant financial strain, especially since I had to book a replacement flight through another provider.Lack of Accountability: Despite their policies and assurances, Gotogate has not taken responsibility for processing my refund. The lack of clear communication and accountability has made the entire process unnecessarily difficult and frustrating.Conclusion:This experience with Gotogate has been incredibly disappointing. Despite their claims, I have yet to receive my refund. I urge Gotogate to address this issue promptly and ensure that customers are treated fairly and transparently.PS: If you refund money, then I will update my review in here!!!!!!!Order Number: 1005-368-079They are still playing by replying with jokes.

"Booked using them over booking.com. Absolutely restrictive and if you want to add baggage their options are super restrictive. Also, whilst the booking fare is either the same or slightly cheaper than the airline website, they do not offer any of the benefits you would get from the airline website.

We cancelled a flight we booked through them through WizzAir (as they could not do it). We then wait for the refund (luckily we put a calendar reminder) only to find no refund, we then had to call them up and they go yes they can see the refund request and ask us if we wanted to process it... why would we not want to process a refund!

"I had a return flight with 3 legs that I needed to change. 1st attempt: I used the live chat, thought I had it resolved in about 20 minutes. Several hours later I received an option where the 3rd flight departed before the 2nd one arrived. 2nd attempt, got back on livechat, had about 40 minutes on waiting before being disconnected. 3rd attempt, again about 40 minutes waiting before being disconnected. 4th attempt, got through after about 30 mins, several hours later I received 2 emails with the same incorrect 3rd flight. 5th attempt, about one hour waiting, get through to someone with very poor English, but this can be worked around, but this person genuinely seemed to have a very hard time grasping that the 3rd flight left before the 2nd arrived. Said he could see that his colleagues had sent me an option so he thought it was resolved. That was the limit of the computational capacity. He eventually tells me that he will refer me to another department who will get back to me. I’m 3 days in at this point, with the flights getting more expensive daily.  I wait another 3 days and hear nothing. I give up and contact the airlines directly to change the flights myself, 2 of them I can, the 3rd one I can’t, it’s locked and only they can do it. So I simply buy a new flight. A week after I get an email saying they have been trying to contact me by phone. I never received any calls. 6th attempt: I try to just get confirmation of what is booked to make sure there are no surprises. 30 mins waiting, the person I’m online with can’t give me any confirmation, needs 5 minutes to process my query. I ask could he please simply tell me what is currently booked, not sure why there needs to be an investigation.

"For what you guys work in this company if you can’t help when it’s need? What do you get paid for? for rudeness and uselessness? Today's situation has driven us crazy, I want add dog to fly but nobody not help with this. Them unswear just we can’t helps. So what you can ?I’ll explain the situation: on May 19, in Paris, the day before our flight to Oslo, we needed to register our dog for a Norwegian flight. For this we called your company, since we bought tickets there. We have done this procedure more than once since we often fly with a dog, and we know how this is done and where we should call to have our dog included in the ticket. but your employees began to claim that they were not able to do this, and that we would contact Norwegian airlines. At Norwegian we were told that your company must open the entrance to the gate in ticket so that we put in system dog 🤯 We wasted 1.5 hours of our time on these useless calls. Why did something that should be done in 10 minutes take so much time and without results? after we spent an hour persuading your employee to give the phone to a person who is higher than him (for example, a manager), your manager said that we have to pay 250 € for this service (when normally it costs a maximum of 100 €) BUT HE DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT OUR DOG WILL BE ADDED ON THE TICKET. and I want to ask a question, what should I pay for then if you don’t even give guarantees?

"Reason for complaint: invalidity of the 4 tickets at check-in, attributable to gotogate.fr.Flight: Basel -->frankfurt --> BEIJING --> GUANGZHOUTo explain, I arrived at Basel Mulhouse airport at 6 a.m., before the scheduled departure time of 11:15 a.m. , along with three other passengers. However, the agent at the airport check-in desk informed us that the four passengers, including me, were unable to check in or board the plane due to a problem with their tickets. This problem could not be resolved on the spot, as we were told that an error had been made in issuing the tickets with Air China, for which your department was responsible. We were perfectly prepared to undertake the trip, with valid passports, proof of exit (for air and rail), and luggage that complied with size and weight requirements.As a result, the four passengers mentioned were prevented from boarding the plane on the planned date. That same day, I spent over 10 hours on the phone with your customer service department trying to resolve the problem. This resulted in an additional charge on my phone bill to contact Air China. Despite my efforts, no satisfactory solution was found by your customer service department. At my own expense, I had to make changes to the tickets, for more than 3000€, in order to obtain four new one-way tickets.However, even after purchasing new tickets from your customer service department, we continued to experience problems. I was forced to stay at the airport overnight in order to keep up to date with the airport service.Here are the problems encountered during check-in the next day with new tickets:- Passenger 1: no ticket issued for this person- Passenger 2: no ticket issued for this person- Passenger 3: ticket with error- Passenger 4: this person has a ticket, but his name appears 2 times on the tickets (his ticket and that of passenger 3) when checking in at the airport.We had to contact Air China in China to solve the problem. However, each time we tried, Air China's customer service department informed us that a malfunction had occurred, attributable to your department's poor processing of airline tickets. After 5 hours of phone calls with your customer service department and Air China's, we were able to find a temporary solution with the tickets provided by GoToGate.However, to my astonishment and displeasure, on landing in Frankfurt, I discovered that Passenger 1's ticket was limited to Frankfurt and did not include the journey to Guangzhou. Similarly, Passenger 2 was unable to fly from Frankfurt to Beijing. Furthermore, Frankfurt airport staff informed us that the Beijing-Guangzhou flight was also incorrect, as it took place on 16/04/2024 at 05:15 (local time) instead of 17/04/2024 at 05:15 (local time). We were forced to buy new tickets from Air China for more than 800€ per ticket. I am outraged and consider this situation to be totally unacceptable in terms of the service provided.In addition, we had to spend the night on the ground in the airport for lack of transport and hotel reservations for the night. The moral and financial damage is considerable. Our professional schedule in China has been totally disrupted, and we have missed some of the trade shows we had planned to visit.I am deeply disappointed with the level of service provided by GoToGate and hope for a fair resolution to compensate for the inconvenience caused. I urge GoToGate to address these issues promptly and take responsibility for the disruptions caused to their customers.

However, Gotogate does NOT respond to our questions with relevant content - just standard responses from some back office abroad.

"Terrible experience with Go To Gate on some flights I wished to change the dates of. I was originally told when I initially enquired that it would be £150 to change the dates, plus any additional costs for the flights themselves. When I went to rebook I was as told completely contradictory information, and that I would be charged for the new tickets outright.

"We booked a return flight via booking.comThe flight was unfortunately cancelled due to a strike.We then had to buy last minute tickets but were told not to worry we would receive the money back from the original flight.So we have now been waiting since the flight was cancelled in February 2024 for the refund (now April 29 2024)The last update was February 8th and it says that Go to Gate contacted the airline. Since then we have had nothing, no refund, just lies.After innumerable phone calls (one positive- they do answer the phone!) but by the 10th call you finally realise there is no personal service here. The calls are scripted and the same conversation is had every time with many apologies for the delay, told to wait a bit longer etc. I can actually now predict what they will say. You have hope at first but over the months you realise its all a total pretence.In the mean time I have personally been in touch with the airline and in the last three months, and I have this in writing, they say they have had nothing from Go to Gate. Our ticket is still showing as Open on their system which means that they can do nothing and will do nothing, as why would they if they haven't had anything from Go to Gate? If they had, there would be some movement now. But they have not had anything. I have it in writing.I have sent a copy of this to Go to Gate many times but no one responds. You just get a variation on the same reply telling you exactly what they said on the phone...over and over again.Then try to get on to booking.com to get help from them is even worse. You have to put your customer ref no before an email or into their phone system and does it work? No.So you are sent round and round in circles.Every time someone says they will help at Go to Gate- they will escalate it to the concerned team, but it's absolute rubbish because when you phone the following week absolutely nothing has been done and no one helps you.Its so frustrating as we are totally entitled to a refund. It is our money.I will 100% never book anything with Booking.com again or recommend anything to do with them to anyone.PS if anyone from go to gate decides to respond to this, I have added the reference code!!!!writing after Go got Gate responded- please note that on other reviews when they respond they say that they would have helped but the reviewer did not put their reference number.I did put our reference number but please note that they have not offered to help in anyway!!!It is now May 12th 2024 and they still have not issued a refund!!!!!",1,Negative,book return flight via bookingcomthe flight unfortunately cancel due strikewe buy last minute ticket tell worry would receive money back original flightso wait since flight cancel february refund april last update february th say go gate contact airline since nothing refund liesafter innumerable phone call one positive answer phone th call finally realise personal service call scripted conversation every time many apology delay tell wait bit long etc actually predict say hope first month realise total pretencein mean time personally touch airline last three month writing say nothing go gate ticket still show open system mean nothing nothing would have not anything go gate would movement anything writingi send copy go gate many time one respond get variation reply tell exactly say phoneover againthen try get bookingcom get help even bad put customer ref email phone system work noso send round round circlesevery time someone say help go gate escalate concern team absolute rubbish phone follow week absolutely nothing do one help youit frustrating totally entitle refund moneyi never book anything bookingcom recommend anything anyonep anyone go gate decide respond add reference codewrite go get gate respond please note review respond say would help reviewer put reference numberi put reference number please note offer help anywayit may th still issue refund
"GotoGate has been my worst nightmare. My recent experience with them was nothing short of a disaster. It all started when my luggage got delayed, causing me immense inconvenience and stress. To make matters worse, I missed my connection due to the self-transfer process, which GotoGate supposedly facilitates. But the real nightmare began when I requested a refund, as per their own policy. Despite their website clearly stating that refunds are available under such circumstances, they outright denied my request. Their excuse? They couldn't find my flight or had no control over my booking. This is utter nonsense and a blatant disregard for their own policies.The level of incompetence and lack of accountability displayed by GotoGate is appalling. Their customer service is non-existent, and their refusal to honor their own refund policy is outrageous. This has been the worst customer experience I've ever had with an airline or booking service.I urge anyone considering booking with GotoGate to think twice. Save yourself the headache and frustration. As for me, I demand a resolution to this matter.

"I am adding to a review I left earlier this year as I have just discovered some extra information that I was not aware of. After GoToGate had unilaterally tried to cancel our flight home from New Zealand, without offering us any alternative (which they could quite simply have done) I ended up making lots of calls to them to try and sort it out. These calls were from Australia and NZ, but to what looked like a London number (although clearly none of the staff were in London but were somewhere in South Asia). They consistently refused to call me back or to provide an alternative way of getting in touch - WhatsApp, Zoom, Skype etc - that would have reduced the number of international phone calls I was having to make. I have just discovered what my phone bill was - and it is utterly shocking. It was hundreds of UK £s. I can't possibly have run up a bill that big without the phone number being a premium rate line - of which there is absolutely no warning. It's just one more sign of their utterly rubbish customer service and it just adds to the feeling that this is a very sketchy company. It might be fine if nothing goes wrong - but as soon as it does, you are in trouble.",1,Negative,add review leave early year discover extra information aware gotogate unilaterally try cancel flight home new zealand without offer we alternative could quite simply do end make lot call try sort call australia nz look like london number although clearly none staff london somewhere south asia consistently refuse call back provide alternative way get touch whatsapp zoom skype etc would reduce number international phone call make discover phone bill utterly shock hundred uk can not possibly run bill big without phone number premium rate line absolutely warn one sign utterly rubbish customer service add feel sketchy company might fine nothing go wrong soon trouble

"Despite meticulously proofreading all names and details, a simple typo in the last names of two passengers slipped through, only to be discovered when confirmation emails arrived. Not only was I expected to pay for their error, but I also felt a complete lack of willingness to accommodate my request, despite my loyalty as a customer and willingness to meet them halfway by paying an airline admin charge.Instead of promptly rectifying the mistake, I received a call informing me of additional fees required for the correction. Their solution? I was instructed to upload passport copies to facilitate the necessary changes. However, what followed was even more infuriating.This, despite the fact that the error stemmed from their own oversight. I requested the agent to reconsider these charges, as it's patently unfair to burden the customer for this. Yet I was willing to meet them halfway and negotiate To add insult to injury, I was told that an email would be sent explaining how I could raise a complaint against this issueg. However, to date, no such email has materialized. It seems that GOTOGATE  not only failed to resolve the issue but has also completely ignored my concerns and shown a lack of empathy towards customers.It's disheartening to witness a company prioritize penny-pinching over genuine customer satisfaction. Not only was I expected to pay for their error, but I also felt a complete lack of willingness to accommodate my request, despite my loyalty as a customer and willingness to meet them halfway by paying an airline admin charge.Save yourself the frustration and choose an airline that values its customers' satisfaction over squeezing every last penny out of them.I know writing this review won't solve my issue as the attitude suggests of the company (ignore and move on, this is not their headache stance) but at least it will warn others of potential such reoccurrence.I have been waiting for several days to hear back from Gotogate regarding a typo issue, but I have not received any response yet. During my last call with their advisor, they assured me that everything would be sent to me via email. However, I have not received any communication from them. It is evident that Gotogate is more concerned about avoiding negative reviews rather than resolving customer issues.

"I booked my flights for July 13-July 20 and when I checked my booking, the flights were both for July 13.  I immediately called the 'help' line and sadly, no one can actually assist you.  My case was 'escalated' to a 'supervisor' on April 19 and I have called back twice and my case is still 'escalated'.  Something went wrong from when I booked and I got my flight info.  NO ONE flies into Croatia and then takes a return flight an hour later.  It is obvious something went wrong and I can't get any help to fix this matter.  I shouldn't have to pay the 100 euro change fee for something that I didn't do.  I just want my flights to be correct.  Looks like I will be forced to pay for the correct date since there is no customer service that can help a customer.  The 3 people I have spoken too have been polite but all they could do is repeat that the case has been escalated and that the 'supervisors', who only work M-F, are busy because of Iran/Israel flight cancellations.  I understand that is important but I think my issue deserves better than waiting 4 days (so far) for a resolution.  If the customer service people can't help us, then what is their purpose.    **update**.

I booked a flexi ticket.  I requested my flight be changed in plenty of time.  They could not help due to a technical error.  I sent around 30 chats on their chat system there was an error with this too.  The chats kept closing or sometimes it wouldn't open at all.  I tried to call and the line was dead.  When they finally managed to respond around a week later they told me it was too late to change my flight and I lost my money.  I have sent around ten email complaints and the people at customer services can't find my booking or history and don't understand the simple issue.  I have wasted my time and a lot of money.  They send template responses that make no sense.  They cannot seem to check the chat history or the email history to see there is a chain of events and proof I tried to cancel in time.  They claim they sent me an email I do not have in my inbox or junk. It feels crazy.  I think they are pretending to not understand in order to not compensate me for the flight I would have cancelled in time for a refund as per their T&C's.  It is appalling.  Please be warned.  DO NOT USE.Re Go To Gate’s response- the order number is 1004-932-280. I have contacted customer services by email 11 times and referenced the number and countless number of chats in their chat system so this reply makes no sense.

"Gotogate have been handling my customer service issue on behalf of Booking.com. I paid for seat reservations on a flight to Japan due to a medical issue- my friend needed an aisle seat. My reservation was processed by my friend’s wasn’t, meaning my friend had to sit next to a window for 17 hours. I asked for a refund and was told the fee was “non-refundable”. The terms and conditions do not say this. When I challenged ir, I was told it was the airline’s fault and to complain to them. After the airline investigated, they found that Booking.com had not sent through the reservation. I have just emailed Gotogate yet again and they said that they “cannot find my booking on the system”. The whole experience has been intensely frustrating. Requests for their complaints policy or escalation have been ignored. I have opened a case with Trading Standards and will be pursuing a refund through my credit card instead. UPDATE (10/06/2024): GoToGate emailed to confirm that the fault lay in their system and have refunded the money.

"Booking.comGotoGateAirAsiaI have not received a refund due for cancelled AirAsia flights booked through Booking.com. The airline rescheduled our return flight by 5 hours, and as we could no longer take the flight Booking.com cancelled our tickets and said that I would receive a full refund. This was when the nightmare began, as I was then informed that the refund request had been rejected, and as their booking partner GotoGate (I was unaware that they used a third party to make the booking) was unable to contact the airline directly I had to do this myself; which I did. AirAsia confirmed that the flights were fully refundable, due to the airline rescheduling the flight by more than 3 hours, but I could not request this myself as it was booked by an “agency”. I sent copies of the online chat to prove this to both Booking and GotoGate, and have spent the last month contacting them to try to resolve this, each time informing them that the airline will not deal with me as the request must come from Booking.com or GotoGate, and each time being told that I had to contact the airline directly. I have even resorted to emailing Paul Downham VP of customer services in Amsterdam, which got me nowhere. This has been extremely stressful and upsetting, and must be resolved.

"Would rate 0 stars if I could!This has been the worst travel experience of my life! DO NOT USE GOTOGATE or BOOKING.COM!I booked an international flight through booking.com as I had heard they were a large and reproable 3rd party booking company. Things seemed good, the airfares seemed to good to be true (because they were!) $1860 for international flights from Aus to Jap, Can and back to Aus. Made an online account with booking.com, entered my details, Full name, passport details and ""display name"" for website use. Done. I didn't notice at the time that the booking.c0m/gotogate system used my ""display name"" for my booking name. The ""display name"" was litterally the name used on the website when I logged in, my full name listed on the saved passport section of the website wasn't used in the final ticket! I discovered this about a month later and contacted booking.c0m/gotogate to get this rectified ASAP, my trip was in 19 days so I needed it done with some urgency! I got a response email: ""Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your request to correct the name on your reservation. We understand the importance of having accurate information, and we apologize for any inconvenience caused.""They asked for my passport details and mentioned it would be take roughly 72 hours to correct their mistake.16 days later! I received an email at 6pm at night on a Sunday with an alternatim:""We have received your request that you wish to change the name of a ticket in your reservation. We always need to follow the airline rules for the ticket that you have booked through us.According to the rules set out by the airline it is possible to change the name with their fee of 76.09 AUD. Also, there is a difference in the fare applicable at the moment of 1846.30 AUD. So total cost for name correction is 1922.39 AUD.If you want to change the name, you first have to pay the amendment fee. Follow this link to get to the payment page for your order:Please note that the link is only valid 2024-01-28 until 21:00 PM.""They gave me a 3 hour window to pay more than the initial ticket cost to ""change the name"".I rang and spoke to customer service and disputed the payment as this mistake was theirs and not mine I should not have to pay the ""difference in fee"", but due to the short nature of the window of payment I would have to pay it if I wished to travel at all (a month of snowboarding between Japan and Canada with non refundable accommodation!) so I paid the amount and Lodged my request for a refund at the time but there goes my spending money for Japan.I completed my trip and returned home when I received a small ($133.66) refund, I enquired once more with customer service as to the reason for such a small refund when I was awaiting a larger refund amount, I was informed this was the refund of the seat costs on the initial ticket that was cancelled. So it seems they cancelled my first ticket, and re booked it under the correct name... not that they ""changed the name"" on the original ticket!The customer service person had a look and saw that I had lodged a request for a refund and confirmed that the amount of $1922.39 was being processed and was in the hands of the Accounts department but that they had no updates for me just yet, this was the 26/02 so just under a month from when I paid the extra amount.I didn't hear back from anyone in customer service or the accounts department until I successfully contacted them again on the 22/3 when I was told I had a case number and that the refund had been approved and would be paid in the next 5 days.Nothing.10/4 I rang and spoke to someone again who told me they would organise for someone from Accounts to contact me back in the next 24-72 hours.18/4 I rang and spoke to someone who gave me an email address to use so I can escalate things myself.So far everyone I had spoken to had promised to escalate the enquiry and organise for someone to contact me back, all the while saying that the refund was being processed and it would simply take another 3-5 days to appear!19/4 I used the email provided to me by the Customer Service representative from the day before and the email bounced back:""Your message wasn't delivered to ***.support because the domain flightsonbooking.support couldn't be found. Check for typos or unnecessary spaces and try again""This is the address copied across from the body of the email they sent to me!So I rang up and said I had been given an incorrect email address, the new customer service representative told me that there was no refund and the case had been closed on the 22/3 but he would get someone from Support and Refunds to contact me and gave me another email address to use...""Please note that we do not support any requests via this channel and we couldn't register your query in our support system""Worst SCAM company!*read before responding gotogate",1,Negative,would rate star couldthis bad travel experience life use gotogate bookingcomi book international flight bookingcom hear large reproable rd party booking company thing seem good airfare seem good true international flight aus jap back aus make online account bookingcom enter detail full name passport detail display name website use do do not notice time bookingcmgotogate system use display name booking name display name litterally name use website log full name list save passport section website be not use final ticket discover month later contact bookingcmgotogate get rectify asap trip day need do urgency get response email thank reach we regard request correct name reservation understand importance accurate information apologize inconvenience causedthey ask passport detail mention would take roughly hour correct mistake day later receive email pm night sunday alternatimwe receive request wish change name ticket reservation always need follow airline rule ticket book usaccording rule set airline possible change name fee aud also difference fare applicable moment aud total cost name correction audif want change name first pay amendment fee follow link get payment page orderplease note link valid pmthey give hour window pay initial ticket cost change namei rang speak customer service dispute payment mistake mine pay difference fee due short nature window payment would pay wish travel month snowboard japan canada non refundable accommodation pay amount lodge request refund time go spend money japani complete trip return home receive small refund enquire customer service reason small refund await large refund amount inform refund seat cost initial ticket cancel seems cancel first ticket book correct name change name original ticketthe customer service person look see lodge request refund confirm amount process hand account department update yet month pay extra amounti do not hear back anyone customer service account department successfully contact tell case number refund approve would pay next daysnothing rang speak someone tell would organise someone account contact back next hour rang speak someone give email address use escalate thing myselfso far everyone speak promise escalate enquiry organise someone contact back say refund process would simply take another day appear use email provide customer service representative day email bounce backyour message be not deliver support domain flightsonbookingsupport could not find check typo unnecessary space try againthis address copy across body email send meso rang say give incorrect email address new customer service representative tell refund case close would get someone support refund contact give another email address useplease note support request via channel could not register query support systemworst scam companyread respond gotogate

We have an entire month long trip booked in Europe, hotels & everything!! I don’t need a refund at this point I was our flights!! We ended up calling the airline directly and not mentioning a 3rd party. The airline itself easily rebooked our flights.

"My experience with GoToGate / booking.com has been extremely frustrating and disappointing. After my flight was cancelled, I had to wait two weeks for an alternative route to be approved, during which GoToGate / booking.com failed to communicate with the airline.

I'm still waiting for a refund for the cancelled flight, and GoToGate / booking.com is trying to shift the blame to the airline, which is unacceptable.

"You will probably be shocked by the lack of customer care.  It is Organisation Neglect. This is my letter to them....Sunday , 15 April, at 23.53, I called to  highlight your flight errors for my booking. You changed all my premium economy seats both ways to economy seating.For my well-being, the economy seats are not suitable for me, and besides, I've paid over 2K for these seats.AGENT 1The agent clarified that it's an error on your part. Apparently, when I extended my return flight, keeping it as premium economy, you changed all my flight seats to the economy.Agent 1 promised me an escalated call back regarding errors made on your part. My flight was booked for 16th April at 19hrs, hence the escalation.You have acknowledged it is an error on your part and that you would take full responsibility to fix it. I was instructed to wait for a call back.NO CALL BACK RECEIVED.Monday 16th April at 11.30hrs I called again.AGENT 2 I was advised that AGENT 1 had NOT escalated my urgent query, even having recorded on your system my urgent situation and that it needed to be acted upon urgently, he made an error by not escalating it.Agent 2 apologised for Agent 1 mistake and errors in my booking, and that she would make sure to escalate and noted on their system that it is a PRIORITY for my flight will be departing in 7 hours' time.She also promised I would receive a call back and sort out my booking. Not to worry, all will be fine for I'm to depart in a few hours' time.NO CALL BACK RECEIVED 18hrs, I called againAGENT 3The agent apologised again and said the email AGENT 2 had written a PRIORITY email to the flight team and promised this time it would be dealt with.   In our conversation, there was no offer of an alternative flight, only to wait for a call back promising they would call back quickly. Obviously and strongly, I expressed my concerns so far. I have not received any information nor emails on how ""you will fix this. ""..NO CALL BACK RECEIVEDI left without knowing  if I would fly.The impact of neglect from you has put me in a precarious position not only emotionally but also other areangement and bookings whilst in Japan.NO CALL BACKTues 14.27hrs talking for 51minsAGENT 4Apparently, the flight team did not read the email sent by AGENT 3.Agent 4 says, "" The flight team didn't call because they thought I was on the flight to Japan""!!! This obviously doesn't make any sense as none of the agents instructed me to go to the airport. I was to wait for a call back..and then he said ""They didn't call because of their opening hours""!!!I'm was instructed again to wait for a call back.16.12hrs NO CALL BACK.It is beyond belief and outrageous how I've been treated.Words can not express the anguish, stress, and trauma I've experienced with your partner.

Everything seemed ok, got the reservation number and email confirmation from gotogate. but after a couple of hours gotogate emailed me again and said it hadnt gone through. They recommended to book directly with the airline - West jet- and said I would get a refund. I decided to book through booking.com instead as they gave me a better discount. To be fair, gotogate emailed me quickly and processed refund within 48 hours. I think there was an IT problem  with that flight because I kept checking with West jet to see if my new booking with booking.com had gone through. After 24 hours i called booking.com who said it hadnt gone through but sorted it straight away.

"Completely Unregulated FraudMy partner and I booked flights to and from Cuba through Gotogate. We spent the additional money to guarantee additional legroom for the flights where we were able to book through the Gotogate system (the long-haul leg outbound was only able to be booked through Iberia directly- by the time I worked this out with no help from Gotogate who just said they couldn't book that leg, it was too late for extra leg room but as it was a daytime leg, my partner and I agreed this was low risk). We both double checked the seating and were happy to go ahead. The reason for this (particularly on the return leg) is that, in addition to being 6'4"" tall, my partner has epilepsy and one of their triggers for seizures is a lack of sleep. The return flight from Havana was overnight so it was imperative that we make sure they were as comfortable as possible to get as much sleep as possible. When we boarded the flight, we aimed for the mid-rear bulkhead as that was where the seats on the seatplan we had booked from were located, only to find that they were in fact standard legroom, mid-aircraft seats and absolutely nowhere near where we had expected them to be. As the flight was full, the aircrew were not able to move my partner to an extra legroom seat and so neither of us slept. When we boarded the short haul flight from Madrid to London, we found that our anticipated overwing exit row seats were actually, again, standard legroom (gallingly, one row behind the extra legroom row).When I complained to Gotogate through their chat function, they accused me of making the error despite the fact that it was for medical grounds and, frankly, I wouldn't be so stupid (no-one wants to be in the air for eight hours wondering if their partner is going to have a fit just to save a few ££). When I queried this and stated that they had put my partner in danger, I was told it was to do with the airline and that, unless I could provide screenshots of the seating plan I booked from months previously, they couldn't do anything. I then requested that they send me the seating chart and price plan that was being used and valid at the time of my booking. They refused. When I stated that if they could not provide evidence that it was me that had made the mistake then they owed me a refund, the agent closed the chat (on this occasion, I have screenshotted the whole convesation). Having investigated, it is clear that Gotogate is completely unregulated and so I'll be reaching out to the office of fair trading in order to obtain refunds for the seats at the very least. I didn't anticipate spending the whole journey home from a wonderful holiday in tears because of a scam booking agency but here we are.",1,Negative,completely unregulated fraudmy partner book flight cuba gotogate spend additional money guarantee additional legroom flight able book gotogate system longhaul leg outbound able book iberia directly time work help gotogate say could not book leg late extra leg room daytime leg partner agree low risk double check seating happy go ahead reason particularly return leg addition tall partner epilepsy one trigger seizure lack sleep return flight havana overnight imperative make sure comfortable possible get much sleep possible board flight aim midrear bulkhead seat seatplan book locate find fact standard legroom midaircraft seat absolutely nowhere near expect flight full aircrew able move partner extra legroom seat neither us sleep board short haul flight madrid london find anticipate overwing exit row seat actually standard legroom gallingly one row behind extra legroom rowwhen complain gotogate chat function accuse make error despite fact medical ground frankly would not stupid noone want air eight hour wonder partner go fit save query state put partner danger tell airline unless could provide screenshot seat plan book month previously could not anything request send seating chart price plan use valid time booking refuse state could provide evidence make mistake owe refund agent close chat occasion screenshotte whole convesation investigate clear gotogate completely unregulated ill reach office fair trading order obtain refund seat least do not anticipate spend whole journey home wonderful holiday tear scam booking agency

"Stumbling on people’s experience here made me remember mine some years ago where I was scammed by GOTOGATEThey converted my ticket to an Open Return ticket valid for about 2years as I could not make the original travel date. When I was now ready to travel on a later date, they systematically frustrated me for many months until I gave up and abandoned my ticket and lost my money - They would not answer phone for hours, and when they do, they would pass me around to different agents or ask me to contact airline directly (knowing fully well the airline will not be able to do anything as tickets was bought from GOTOGATE!)Very terrible and traumatising experience at the time. ———————-The order number was L6V5F1The VIRGIN booking reference was DSENKFThe GOTOGATE  booking ref was P8CNOFIn 2021, I couldn’t make my return flight with my family so I had to contact you make a date change in order to avoid a “No Show”. When I was now ready with a date to book my travel, GOTOGATE became suddenly unwilling to help despite several frustrating calls and emails which lasted about 3months. It was obvious they did not want to rebook my flight because they were not going to make huge money from it. They kept tossing me about with flimsy excuses, ranging from a request that I book over the phone, and when I do so, I’m told to either wait for a call, or call the airline myself to rebook, or the airline system are down, or they can’t see my booking!… you just name it!They systematically frustrated my efforts to rebook my open return flight until I had to give up and abandoned my ticket with them, thus purchasing a new return ticket as my chosen date was now near.

On my third attempt I was told that they were unable to advise my about changing my flight and that their ""internal support team"" would email me. That was 36 hours ago. So I've been trying to move my flight for around 5 days now and I *still* don't know if I can. Aside from that, finding your booking with the actual airline is not straightforward.

"My flight was cancelled by the airline in 2021 over 2 years later and a lot of fighting I still have no refund of over £600 and I will not get it. I foolishly trusted them and initially agreed for them to chase the refund. Despite months of chasing and hours of phoning them it was only July 2023 they got through to the refund team of the airline and requested it. The airline refused the refund stating it was down to 'customers choice' - of course was not and should have been disputed by Go to Gate as they had all the evidence and were the ones to have told me the airline cancelled it. Did they email me or call me with this update? No they updated it on my original booking on the go to gate website which of course I never go on or needed to anymore or communicated with them about it. Now chasing up they tell me the airline says too much time has gone. They did not advocate for me, I had to spend hours begging them to do so, when they did they did it wrong and because of their error I now don't get my money back. Do go to gate have it? Do the airline? When I quite understandably got upset and appealed to the go to gate staff who told me it had gone on for too long and I had to go to airline myself (they already told me I can only go through go to gate) he hung up on me. Fantastic. Enjoy your sad little life Go to Gate! I've just received an email from the person who hung up and stated 'we have been told you want to reschedule your booking' so clearly they haven't read or understood any of my situation and didn't listen/understand anything I told them over the phone - once again, please don't book with them!!I'm lucky I'm not dependent on it or hadn't been saving up for that once in a life time trip and had other means.

I'd give them less than 1 star if I had that option. I booked my ticket over 2 months ago. They changed my return twice and at this moment I'm left stranded in between my destination and home. Their UK customer service phone line is busy nonstop and the live chat seems to be dead. I asked if I could get a refund for the return flight since they can't get me back home and they couldn't give me a straight answer. I'm supposed to fly in a week and as of now have no way of getting home. The worst!!!! Better to spend more and book with the airline directly. They make their money by cheating people out of their hard earned money. STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!! Update: After many useless and frustrating chats with gotogate they offered a full refund since they couldn't get me home. I ended up booking directly with the airline for double what I paid gotogate. But at this point it was last minute and I was happy to have something confirmed. If I had booked directly with the airline originally it would have cost me less (more than gotogate but less than I ended up paying). Let's see how long it takes me to get my refund.

Two months on no refund and they claimed they cant find proof I paid despite their reply email having it.

I am now issuing a money claim against them in the County Court to recover my money and I would strongly recommend everyone in the UK being scammed by Gotogate does this as its probably the only way they will start to take customers seriously when a Court orders them to pay back what they owe for their mistakes.

"All seemed good - until you need their help. I made a simple mistake - bought the SAME flight twice. It was a complicated multi-destination vacation, I was arranging 6 flights for 3 people, and by mistake booked one flight twice. Simple solution, right - I immediately contacted the airline, please cancel one of the two flights! Of course, airline sends me to my travel agent who I booked it with, GoToGate. Their chat agent tells me, I need to get 'authorization to cancel' from the airline. Back to the airline - they say, no, there's no such thing as authorization, GoToGate should very simply contact our helpdesk, we'll cancel it, reimburse you! Back and forth for 3 weeks, I spent literally hours on hold with airline, chatting with GoToGate. I find out GoToGate never contacted the airline with this simple request, going in circles, very painful experience, my $400 absolutely unnecessarily wasted. When you buy the same thing in a store, you go back, show receipt, you get money back. Same thing here, I have all receipts - airline ready to help me - but had to go through GoToGate who were sending me back to the airline (that's NOT how it works in the travel industry).

"i wish there was an option for zero star. We booked return flights for 4 people via gotogate, and then the airlines switched the times. We called gotogate to cancel, were assured it would happen within the week and no mention of any fees. 10 days later, when we call up to see what was happening - they told us that there would be be fees from the airline - $160 per person, per way - coming to $1280, not counting their own fees of $360. I was horrified by this - especially when i called the airline directly, and was told that when the airlines adjust the flighttimes significantly, it can be cancelled for free, but that it would have to be done via gotogate. I called back gotogate who assured me a callback within 24 hours - 10 days and i'm still waiting. You can't get through to anyone who can actually help you.

I am am TRYING to request a full refund from your agents, which according to the airline should be free - and the answer I got - after 3 weeks - was that it would cost $1,600 for this! THAT is the point of my review. After escalating the request and being promised a callback in 24 hours - it's been two weeks and nothing, whilst the flight dates are coming up and we have not been able to make other arrangements as they keep ignoring us.

"I recently booked an air ticket with Gogo Gate for a flight from Dubai to Sydney and back. Unfortunately, my experience with them has been nothing short of disappointing.The first red flag arose when I noticed that they had misspelled my name on the ticket. Despite contacting their customer service multiple times to rectify this error, they failed to provide a satisfactory solution. This oversight caused unnecessary stress and uncertainty about whether I would encounter issues during check-in and boarding.To compound matters, when I requested a refund due to their mistake and the ensuing inconvenience, Gogo Gate displayed a complete lack of empathy and accountability. They refused to provide me with the credits I rightfully deserved, leaving me out of pocket and deeply dissatisfied with their service.Overall, my experience with Gogo Gate has been marred by incompetence and a disregard for customer satisfaction.

Tickets were genuine and a reasonably low price. However online checking experienced what they termed 'technical issues' after validation step. On phoning them they said there is nothing they can do and to contact ryanair the direct. We did this and ryanair said as we had booked through a third party there was nothing they could do either other than to provide us boarding passes at the airport. We arrived early to the airport and were informed the price to print the boarding passes would be £55 per person. Whilst on holiday we phoned gotogate to try and get the inbound check in sorted. Same problem and same useless customer service response. Ryanair informed us they see this happen all the time. So it cost us £55 on the way home too. In total an addition £110 on top of the flight price. May as well avoided the budget airline and travelled in a bit more luxury.

"No doubt others have had all sorts of mixed experiences with go to gate and I can only speak based on my limited purchases. The whole process is very efficient and clear. Was very happy that it was possible to redeem a flight voucher upon simply by entering the code when buying tickets. They could have made that clearer from the beginning because it was only when I got to the pay page that this option was shown. Still great though, better than phoning up and speaking to advisors for hours and so on.

It’s been 3 months since my flight was changed and go to gates advice me that I would get back my refund.

Numerious live chats and emails later, gotogate keeps giving me conflicting information, copy pasting answers and hasn’t even reached out to the agency let alone secure my refund (it’s been over 2 months).

"Really terrible customer service. Our flight time for four people was changed around ten days before departure. We weren’t able to make the new time so contacted Gotogate and the airline to discuss switching to a new flight. The airline told us Gotogate had put their own details as the contact details so they could (understandably) not discuss the reservation with us, and Gotogate must contact them directly. I then emailed Gotogate over ten times requesting they do so. They repeatedly replied again asking me to contact the airline myself, despite both informing them of their refusal and eventually forwarding emails from the airline confirming they could not discuss the reservation with me. The time we had to make changes came and went, and we ended up out of pocket and having to spend more money on a bus journey instead of the flight we had paid for. I emailed Gotogate again to underline that they had deprived us of any opportunity to rearrange the flight service we had paid for, and was again sent what felt like automated emails asking me to discuss with the airline. I want to underline I had no problems with the airline but with Gotogate’s terrible customer service. I feel they took our money and were not interested in helping us with the reservation.

"I recently had an exceedingly frustrating experience with Gotogate while attempting to book a flight found via Google Flights. The initial price listed was reasonable and prompted me to proceed with the booking process on the company’s website. However, this process quickly became cumbersome due to the excessive amount of information requested, significantly slowing down the procedure.Despite this, I diligently filled out all required fields, including sensitive credit card information, expecting to finalize my booking at the advertised price. Yet, upon selecting the payment option, I was confronted with a sudden and unwelcome surprise - a pop-up notification informing me of a price increase, approximately 20% higher than originally advertised.This unexpected hike not only wasted a substantial amount of my time but also felt like a deceptive practice, leading to a loss of trust in Gotogate. I ultimately decided against completing the booking due to this disheartening experience. It is disconcerting to encounter such practices, and I hope my feedback prompts Gotogate to adopt a more transparent and customer-friendly approach in the future.",1,Negative,recently exceedingly frustrating experience gotogate attempt book flight find via google flight initial price list reasonable prompt proceed booking process company website however process quickly become cumbersome due excessive amount information request significantly slow proceduredespite diligently fill require field include sensitive credit card information expect finalize booking advertise price yet upon select payment option confront sudden unwelcome surprise popup notification inform price increase approximately high originally advertisedthis unexpected hike waste substantial amount time also feel like deceptive practice lead loss trust gotogate ultimately decide complete booking due disheartening experience disconcert encounter practice hope feedback prompt gotogate adopt transparent customerfriendly approach future

"TERRIBLE! DO NOT USE GOTOGATE THEY ARE THIEVING LYING POS. I made a reservation from Amman to Tel Aviv in July of last year. I also made a reservation from Tel Aviv to Cairo in July. Since then a war has broken out so we are unable to travel to Tel Aviv, Israel. I called in December to get the flight from Tel Aviv to Cairo cancelled. GREAT! Flight cancelled, refund in my account within two days. I also called in December to get the flight from Amman to Tel Aviv changed, to go from Amman to Cairo. No problems, was charged $506 extra to change flight & was told within 2 days will receive a confirmation email. A week and a half goes by without a confirmation email. I then receive an email from them saying they were unable to change my flight and a refund would be issued within two weeks. Two weeks had passed, no refund. Which was strange because the last cancellation I had was with the same airline and I got that refund in two days, but nothing with this one. So I called them, they said I needed to wait maybe another week. Waited another week - NO REFUND! So I called and they said they were waiting on the airline. I said well can you refund me my $506 extra I paid for new flights that you could process. Sure - refund was in my account within two days. However still no refund from original flight. It’s now mid March and I have rang almost every week if not two weeks to ask what the hell is going on. Assured everytime my request is being escalated blah blah blah.

"It should be NO star actually. Will NEVER use this agency any more.My first time to write online review. I have to tell you DO NOT use this agency! Extremely BAD experience. Because of health reason, I would like to update my mother's tickets to open tickets (an open-status ticket type at Turkish airline, which will charge 200 dollars later for rescheduling and of course need to plus fare difference if any). The agency said that the tickets that i have are already open tickets and i can wait until later after the departure date to reschedule. Then, I felt strange (if i miss the flight then it will be my own fault right, logically?). Then i decided to call the airline for verification. The Turkish airline told me that what the agency said was NOT true - my tickets are still ""up-coming tickets"" not ""open tickets"", and it is likely that the agency just wanted to cheat more money, because: (1) first, no-show on the departure flight - charge 400 dollars, (2) then, reschedule a new flight - charge 200 dollars. What is worse, often, when you will decide the new date and call them for reschedule / issue new tickets, the agency TOGOGATE will say that they cannot find your ticket any more in the system because that you have miss the original flight. So, you will lose all the money! Oh, that sounds very dangerous - then i decided to cancel the flight, because that I do not trust the agency any more. So i started asking how to do cancellation instead. Then, the agency told me different fees to pay - even the same service person on the phone told me three different sums / amount of fees just within 30 minutes. I was told that I cannot cancel the flight tickets myself or cancel it with the airline. By then, i had spent 2 hours on this back and forth. Too impossible to stand... So i decided to cancel the flights, with whatever fee that they wanted to charge. In the end, the cancellation cost me 900 dollars for my parents' two tickets. I asked the agency phone service for an email confirmation regarding this, because of zero trust on them now. They said that they sent to me twice, but i got only once. If i did not insist on seeing the email confirmation before hanging up the phone call, i do not know what would happen later. We will need to see what will happen to the refund later. Will update here as soon as i know.To sum up, I have been flying internationally with different airlines and various agencies for 20 years.

"Still waiting for the refund from July 23. Flights were cancelled because of a fire in Catania Airport. Since then i have chased booking.com / gotogate weekly for my refund.

"I believe to be involved in fraudulent practices with Gotogate. By the way I am a regular travellaer 7-9 times a year and never had issues with other travel website.Recently, I made a booking through their website for a flight, the following day I received an email that my flight has been cancelled and asked me to confirm so I can receive all my money back. I called them and they confirm verbally as well as by email I will get back all my money in 10 working days. After 3 weeks I was shocked as I only received one quarter of my ticket price. Upon contacting their customer service, I was met with 5 staff unhelpful responses and a lack of transparency regarding the reason of the refund, they asked me to contact the airlines which I refused as I got the ticket from Gotogate nothing between me and the airline . Despite providing all necessary information and documentation, I received no satisfactory explanation or resolution to the issue. I kept receiving an automated email kept asking the same every time for PDF file which I did it from first email. They did it in purpose as they don’t want to give the rest of the refund.

I had booked ticket for my son in Sept 2022 which had to be cancelled. The company executive advised that the refund will be made in few days. It has now been almost 1.5 years despite writing so many emails and speaking to them the refund has not been received. The booking ref is LQD3VU.18.03.2024-Thanks the revert. But cannot even think that  it takes 1.5 yrs to get the refund and your response is the same from the day one. I had even checked with Airlines in Feb 2023 and they responded verbally  that no such request had been made. The amount is not small ( INR 48 K) and remains in suspense even after 1.5 yrs.

"One of our connecting flights returning from New Zealand was changed by the airline which made it impossible to make the next flight! Go To Gate informed us a month before the date of travel by email of the change, all good.We contacted them the next day to see if we could change dates, times etc and waited, and waited, a couple of phone calls to jog their memories untill 2 weeks prior to us flying it got to the point we hadn't heard anything so decided to cancel the whole holiday which was one of the options on the original email from Go To Gate.Now the fun starts!Phone call after phone call requesting that the flights be cancelled were answered and we were assured that the request had been put to the airlines until the day before we were due to travel when the last person we spoke to said 'I will need to notify the airline that you won't be turning up for your flight tomorrow'.....'WHAT!'.....the request for the cancellation of the flights was made two weeks before we were due to fly so why was there a need to notify the airline we weren't flying, they should already have known!Alarm bells are starting to ring!Anyway we get to 5th January (after a fair few phone calls in-between where we told by any number of advisors that as the matter had been escalated to their refund department they can't help us and to be patient!) joy of joy a refund had been received by Go To Gate and the payment would be processed back to our original payment method, usually within 6 days or if not they would contact us! Now there is no indication of how much money we are getting back, just one of the airlines or all 3 that we had to book to get us there and back but you cannot speak to the refund department!So here we are 69 days later, another dozen or so phone calls and emails and STILL no refund! There is no complaints form to complete, we were promised an email with a form attached....yep you guessed it, it never arrived....the threat of small claims court proceedings solicited quite a quick response but no further on and still another half a dozen emails with the standard we are dealing with your request!Go To Gate you are a joke of a company and I will be telling everyone to stay well clear of booking with you!We look forward to your response from our small claims court proceedings!",1,Negative,one connect flight return new zealand change airline make impossible make next flight go gate inform us month date travel email change goodwe contact next day see could change date time etc wait wait couple phone call jog memory untill week prior we fly get point have not hear anything decide cancel whole holiday one option original email go gatenow fun startsphone call phone call request flight cancel answer assure request put airline day due travel last person speak say need notify airline will not turn flight tomorrowwhatthe request cancellation flight make two week due fly need notify airline be not fly already knownalarm bell start ringanyway get th january fair phone call inbetween tell number advisor matter escalate refund department can not help we patient joy joy refund receive go gate payment would process back original payment method usually within day would contact we indication much money get back one airline book get we back speak refund departmentso day later another dozen phone call email still refund complaint form complete promise email form attachedyep guess never arrivedthe threat small claim court proceeding solicit quite quick response still another half dozen email standard deal requestgo gate joke company tell everyone stay well clear book youwe look forward response small claim court proceeding

"Outrageous & unacceptable behaviour by GotoGateMy order number: MLCQ9SI am expressing my utter dismay and outrage at the outrageous and utterly disgusting behaviour exhibited by GOTOGATE in handling my case as a disabled passenger. Despite my repeated attempts to resolve the matter, I have been met with nothing but ignorance and negligence.I provided a cancellation notice for my order number MLCQ9S on December 16th of last year due to my wife's denial of boarding caused by a transit visa confusion. Despite this, GOTOGATE has continuously ignored my pleas for assistance. Their response, dated December 24th, 2023, was nothing short of inadequate and dismissive.GOTOGATE initially agreed to refund the return tickets, only to later backtrack on their promise and shift the responsibility onto WhizzAir and Saudi Airlines. However, both airlines have unequivocally stated that the refund must be processed through GOTOGATE, contrary to GOTOGATE's claims.I have tirelessly called and emailed both airlines, only to be met with frustration and dead ends. GOTOGATE, in a blatant display of irresponsibility, has washed their hands of the matter, despite being fully aware that the refund must be paid through them.This unacceptable behavior has caused immense stress and financial strain on me and my family. As a disabled person, I rely on the integrity and efficiency of service providers like GOTOGATE to ensure my travel arrangements are handled with the utmost care and professionalism. However, their actions have demonstrated a complete lack of respect and disregard for my rights as a passenger.I demand immediate action to rectify this situation. GOTOGATE must honor their commitment to refund the tickets as promised and provide compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused. Failure to do so will result in further escalation of this matter to the relevant authorities and regulatory bodies.I expect a prompt and satisfactory resolution to this matter. Anything less would be a clear indication of GOTOGATE's disregard for the well-being of their customers, particularly those with disabilities.Sincerely,Abdul Kalam",1,Negative,outrageous unacceptable behaviour gotogatemy order number mlcqsi express utter dismay outrage outrageous utterly disgusting behaviour exhibit gotogate handling case disabled passenger despite repeat attempt resolve matter meet nothing ignorance negligencei provide cancellation notice order number mlcqs december th last year due wife denial boarding cause transit visa confusion despite gotogate continuously ignore plea assistance response date december th nothing short inadequate dismissivegotogate initially agree refund return ticket later backtrack promise shift responsibility onto whizzair saudi airline however airline unequivocally state refund must process gotogate contrary gotogates claimsi tirelessly call emailed airline meet frustration dead end gotogate blatant display irresponsibility wash hand matter despite fully aware refund must pay themthis unacceptable behavior cause immense stress financial strain family disabled person rely integrity efficiency service provider like gotogate ensure travel arrangement handle utmost care professionalism however action demonstrate complete lack respect disregard right passengeri demand immediate action rectify situation gotogate must honor commitment refund ticket promise provide compensation distress inconvenience cause failure result escalation matter relevant authority regulatory bodiesi expect prompt satisfactory resolution matter anything less would clear indication gotogate disregard wellbee customer particularly disabilitiessincerelyabdul kalam

"I do not recommend to book through Gotogate and I won't do it anymore. I have booked my trips multiple times through Gotogate, but today I got a message of the cancellation of the first flight on my trip.First time I contacted the chat of Gotogate I got only one option to rebook the flight, by delaying 1 full day the departure, and duplicating the stopovers and the total duration of the flight. i asked if there were flights before the planned departure. I was flexible with up to 4 days earlier. The response is that they checked and there were no options. Obviously I declined their proposal and I did my own search with the airline. I found multiple options for the same flight as original ( or very similar with less than 30 minutes difference) for the 3 previous days. I contacted again the customer service via their chat function. This time the agent gave me the option to flight the next day, exactly same flight (so only 1 stopover instead of 2 proposed earlier) and half the duration of previous option. I informed the agent beforehand that there were options for the days before but the agent offered only the option to flight the day after which was not convenient for me. The agent wanted to charge me a fee to check other flights before the date. I found this very shady. The fee is not reimbursable if the airlines declines the rebooking. Therefore, I don't recommend to book throught Gotogate, because if there is an issue, they see an opportunity to get more money from you. At the end what seems cheap, might become more expensive. Note the difference in prices today is not that much, so it is worth to go for the airline directly.

Do NOT use! Not helpful - staff don't care - don't accept complaints- spoke to about 10 members - they simply don't care and are most unhelpful. The company itself is also just not caring how things work and if they provide good or bad service.  They wouldn't notify you if your flight is cancelled by the airline and I had the luck of finding myself by chance - then paying a fortune for new tickets as it was last minute booking. I won't use again even if price is a bit cheaper- not worth it. Edit: FYI refund of the small amount was issued from the airline itself. But obviously because I was not informed of cancellation until last minute I paid tripple the price for new ticket. Just so people don't look at the reply and think it's a good company.

"I booked for my senior parents to fly from the UK - Australia. I paid the additional seating fees, chose seats and checked out. However, the fees charged appear to be only to request they be seated together. When I go to Etihad I have to pay hundreds more to identify the preferred seat.

The flight times have also changed by many hours with 8 hrs lay over (was 2) and 5 hour layover (was one).

"This platform and service is absolutely horrible. I booked a trip through gotogate and 5 hours later wanted to cancel it because something came up. Not even 12 hours went by and the customer service had no idea how to assist me. They only provide a cellphone number, no email address or text message in order to speak to the service. The customer service told me after 5 times of calling them that I needed to directly contact the different airlines because they don't have access to the site. Yet, as I tried doing this, the direct airlines would not speak to me because I booked through gotogate. Therefore, this platform is absolutely useless- they don't even try assisting you and push you over to the airlines directly which actually can't even speak to you if you didn't directly book through them. On top of this, keeping in mind I wanted to cancel only 5 hours after having made the booking, they will not even cancel my trip, and give me a refund. I attempted writing several emails to gotogate, and also attempted calling several times and have received no response.

"On September 5, 2023, I bought a multi-destination ticket with Gotogate travel agency for the Dubai-Jeddah (15/10/2023) and Riyadh-Dubai (22/10/2023) routes.This is a tourist trip. During the purchase process, on the Gotogate website, there was no reference to a flight or flights specifically dedicated to a religious pilgrimage. The same was true of the confirmation email from Gotogate.The cost of the ticket was 389.99 GBP which was paid with my card for a total cost of 470.25 EUR.On October 13, 2023, I received an email from the airline operating the flights (Fly Dubai) informing me that the Dubai-Jeddah flight was a specific flight reserved for pilgrims with ""Umrah"" visas or GCC citizens only, which I therefore could not take.On October 13, 2023, I called Gotogate customer service to complain about this unacceptable situation. Gotogate had sold me, without any prior information, a Dubai-Jeddah ticket requiring a specific religious visa. This is not the case for standard Dubai-Jeddah flights for a citizen holding a Schengen passport, which is my case. Despite my complaint, Gotogate's customer service department refused to admit they were wrong. The advisor offered to change the Dubai-Jeddah flight for another non-religious flight on the same day with the same airline (Fly Dubai) at a time compatible with my obligations, paying a supplement of 198.34 GBP, or 229.32 EUR (at the average exchange rate of the day 1 GBP = 1.1562 EUR). Faced with this constraint, I had to accept and received confirmation by email.Still on October 13, 2023, after receiving confirmation by email, I received a call from Gotogate's customer service department informing me that the ticket could not be issued and that there was no other flight available on the same day (15/10/2023) at a time compatible with my obligations. Despite my protest and the mention of the confirmation, Gotogate's customer service department left the file in abeyance.On October 14, 2023, I called Gotogate customer service again. The advisor again told me that there were no flights available for 15/10/2023 at a time compatible with my obligations. The advisor then confirmed that I could book another ticket with another travel agency or airline and that I would be fully reimbursed by Gotogate for the booking, i.e. GBP 389.99 + GBP 198.34 = GBP 588.33; this call was presumably recorded by Gotogate.On 15/10/2024, I booked a similar ticket with my card directly with Emirates for a total of 862.15 EUR.Despite Gotogate's customer service commitment on 14/10/2023, I received no refund by 01/03/2024, i.e. more than 4 months later. This is obviously shocking, scandalous and unprofessional on Gotogate's part.This misadventure represents an additional cost of 862.15 EUR (new Emirates ticket) + 229.32 EUR (modification requested by Gotogate having no effect) i.e. 1091.47 EUR.I therefore demand a full refund of my additional costs from Gotogate.@ Gotogate. Without immediate action on your part to reimburse me for all incremental costs (1091.47 EUR), the next step is a formal legal complaint for scam, false information. Reservation MHMSM7. Your detailed response is expected shortly.And a word of advice to potential Gotogate users: please run away from this dishonest agency.",1,Negative,september buy multidestination ticket gotogate travel agency dubaijeddah riyadhdubai routesthis tourist trip purchase process gotogate website reference flight flight specifically dedicated religious pilgrimage true confirmation email gotogatethe cost ticket gbp pay card total cost euron october receive email airline operating flight fly dubai inform dubaijeddah flight specific flight reserve pilgrim umrah visas gcc citizen therefore could takeon october call gotogate customer service complain unacceptable situation gotogate sell without prior information dubaijeddah ticket require specific religious visa case standard dubaijeddah flight citizen hold schengen passport case despite complaint gotogate customer service department refuse admit wrong advisor offer change dubaijeddah flight another nonreligious flight day airline fly dubai time compatible obligation pay supplement gbp eur average exchange rate day gbp eur face constraint accept receive confirmation emailstill october receive confirmation email receive call gotogate customer service department inform ticket could issue flight available day time compatible obligation despite protest mention confirmation gotogate customer service department leave file abeyanceon october call gotogate customer service advisor tell flight available time compatible obligation advisor confirm could book another ticket another travel agency airline would fully reimburse gotogate booking ie gbp gbp gbp call presumably record gotogateon book similar ticket card directly emirate total eurdespite gotogate customer service commitment receive refund ie month later obviously shock scandalous unprofessional gotogate partthis misadventure represent additional cost eur new emirate ticket eur modification request gotogate effect ie euri therefore demand full refund additional cost gotogate gotogate without immediate action part reimburse incremental cost eur next step formal legal complaint scam false information reservation mhmsm detail response expect shortlyand word advice potential gotogate user please run away dishonest agency

"I booked a flight with Royal Jordanian through Booking.com.  Apparently they used Gotogate.I booked 2 business class airfares and paid 3392.87 GBP on the 31st May 2024 for flights in September 6th and 11th.  Booking.com order was OBHYAF. A couple of weeks later I got an email from RJ, saying there had been a change to my flight, it was now economy class, and have a nice flight!  No offer of a refund for price difference.  I contacted Booking.com and said I wanted business class, they said they could not do that (plane was economy only), I said I wanted a refund of the price difference, they said RJ would not do that.  I said I wanted to cancel and get a refund, they said OK, they would process that.  I got an email saying flight had been cancelled and a refund would take about 2 weeks.  This was in August 2023. A couple of weeks later I got an email from gotogate saying RJ had changed our seat numbers back to originals so our booking was all good.  However, the class was still economy.  And in the meantime I had booked new flights with Turkish Airlines (who were fabulous, I will say).So, then started a protracted discussion with Gotogate, which could only be done by me ringing their UK phone number (why? to prevent people ringing?)  They promised me numerous times that they were cancelling the flight, but it did not occur.  I contacted RJ direct, who were not very helpful, but did tell me that the booking was still active.  With that information I managed to get Gotogate to actually cancel the booking.  They said I would have to pay a fee, plus airport taxes (why?  I wasn't flying?).  The last contact I had was the 5th of September 2023.  It is now February 2024 and no refund and no contact.

These people are scammers still waiting for my refund 16days later after they’d said i would receive it in the next 24hours and that was on 8th February have contacted them near enough everyday after that they keep saying refund has been sent and that they will send me a transaction number which iam still waiting for. Obviously refund has not been sent that’s why they have no transaction number. I’ve heard from other people they will not send your refund and expect you to just give up. I’ve been in touch with a company that deals with type of situations and will hopefully be compensated soon.

"Update 14/03/23:  Your reply is a lie, I checked with Turkish airlines and they said there’s no schedule change.  Also, the changes happened instantly as soon as I made payment, that’s really convinient for you.  Lastly, I have searched the same flight and screen recorded it multiple times since the date of the booking and the flights I wanted still come up and to make it worse, GTG are still offering those flights.  STOP TELLINGS LIES AND STEALING FROM INNOCENT CUSTOMERS.  And I did ask for a full refund because of the changes but GTG wanted £204 cancellation fee.  Seems like that’s what you were banking on! I want a FULL REFUND!!!Original review below: I booked flights for my family holiday, ensuring I kept connections as short as possible.  After I paid, my outbound flight was changed and a 9-hour layover connecting flight was added instead.  When I reached out to Go to Gate customer service they offered to cancel but wanted to charge me £204 cancellation fee.  To make matters worse, they also sent me an email saying they had to cancel my requests for check-in luggage, so now they expect me to fly with 4 kids and no luggage.  I called and spoke to Turkish Airlines, who confirmed that some agents do dodgy things like this to make money and save money.  I have screen recordings and screen captures of me searching the flights via Skyscanner and then going to Go to Gate website, which is still showing the flight as I had booked it.  Something really dodgy going on here and I will get to the bottom of it. If I do not hear back from anyone at Go to Gate today, I will contact my card provider, I will also make a complaint to Turkish Airlines and Skyscanner.  I hope the issue can be resolved and it's a matter of system error and not deception.",1,Negative,update reply lie check turkish airline say there s schedule change also change happen instantly soon make payment that s really convinient lastly search flight screen record multiple time since date book flight wanted still come make bad gtg still offer flight stop telling lie steal innocent customer ask full refund change gtg want cancellation fee seem like that s banking want full refundoriginal review book flight family holiday ensure keep connection short possible pay outbound flight change hour layover connect flight add instead reach go gate customer service offer cancel want charge cancellation fee make matter bad also send email say cancel request checkin luggage expect fly kid luggage call speak turkish airline confirm agent dodgy thing like make money save money screen recording screen capture search flight via skyscanner go go gate website still show flight book something really dodgy go get bottom hear back anyone go gate today contact card provider also make complaint turkish airline skyscanner hope issue resolve matter system error deception

"Having booked return flights with Go To Gate for a trip to Vietnam and downloaded the app so that I could get updates, all seemed to be going to plan. Until, I arrived at Heathrow to find that my flight had been cancelled without any notification what so ever. In fact, whilst I was stood there under the cancelled sign I got a notification from GTG advising that my flight was running to schedule! Unfortunately the airline didn’t have a service desk at the airport so an hours worth of communication via the GTG chat function followed whereby they would only rebook me with the same airline for the following evening (not acceptable for various reasons due to plans made) and wouldn’t help in transferring me to flights with a different airline. I ended up cancelling my booking and finding an alternative flight leaving that same evening via Skyscanner (albeit more expensive and with a 15 hour stop over in Bangkok airport….where I am now, killing time by trying to warn all of you lovely people to book with this company at your peril!) and the refund, I’m told will take approx. 2 weeks to be processed.

"Purchased tickets through GTG and decided to change the itinerary - when calling customer service I inquired into whether changing the itinerary was possible and was assured but customer service that we would be refunded but there would be some fees - I took this information to my travel partner before confirming and we decided to proceed. Well that's when things took a turn; the next customer service agent said that we would not get any refund and all the fees we had to pay would be more than the refund should have been but they would cancel the flight for us anyway. I insisted this couldn't be the case as I had been told previously that although there would be fees, we would get some funds returned. I requested the call be escalated and was told there were no supervisors/management working that day but since another team had confirmed I would get a refund they would honor that. They said they would have a manager call me the next day - not surprisingly there was no call, so I called back and had another agent who also said there would be no refund even after I was told there would be one, and then told that the agents would honor what the first agent had said. I was told again there was no management/no supervisor on to escalate to and that they would call me back. Now on day three, still no phone call so I call back again and get a fourth agent who reads the notes on file and says that there may be a small refund but there are fees - which is what the first agent said. After 4 phone calls to GTG - no return calls from them and over 4 hours on the phone I was finally told I would get a refund and I got the information in writing. They told me I would only get about $130... I ended up getting almost $350. Do not work with this company, they will waste your time and jerk you around. Totally unprofessional, they could have saved so much time and aggravation by sticking to their word from the first agent.",1,Negative,purchase ticket gtg decide change itinerary call customer service inquire whether change itinerary possible assured customer service would refund would fee take information travel partner confirming decide proceed well that s thing take turn next customer service agent say would get refund fee pay would refund would cancel flight we anyway insist could not case tell previously although would fee would get fund return request call escalate tell supervisorsmanagement work day since another team confirm would get refund would honor say would manager call next day surprisingly call call back another agent also say would refund even tell would one tell agent would honor first agent say tell managementno supervisor escalate would call back day three still phone call call back get fourth agent read note file say may small refund fee first agent say phone call gtg return call hour phone finally tell would get refund get information writing tell would get end get almost work company waste time jerk around totally unprofessional could save much time aggravation stick word first agent

Terrible customer service. Wish I had read the reviews before booking with this company. I paid for the privilege to have a flexible ticket just to discover that it was completely useless. When I attempted to change my return flight ( which took several hours using their chat system!) I was quoted a price which came up to almost the same price as the original ticket. The virtual assistant kept telling me there were no seats available on my chosen dates yet when checking directly with the airline that was not the case. This company clearly has no interest in maintaining good customer relations with their client. Never again will I knowingly use their services.,1,Negative,terrible customer service wish read review book company pay privilege flexible ticket discover completely useless attempt change return flight take several hour use chat system quote price come almost price original ticket virtual assistant keep tell seat available choose date yet check directly airline case company clearly interest maintain good customer relation client never knowingly use service

"This company had not paid for our luggage to be included on our return home despite having confirmed in an email that it was included - we had certainly paid for it!After two hours of online chat with a customer service rep called Nancy, the company agreed to reimburse us up to £375 and we should pay ourselves - it was just too late for them to do anything so close to our return flight. We asked for email confirmation of this which could not be provided (who knows why??) So took screenshots of the conversation and went ahead and paid the £270 required making sure I got receipts and paperwork showing it had not been included.On my return I contacted the company to request my refund with everything I had as evidence. Everything seemed to be going well then they asked (again!!) For proof of purchase and I filled in a form. Having not heard anything for two weeks I chased it up, only to be told my claim couldn't be made because I had no invoice from the airline - who ever gets an invoice at a check in desk??

In this case the refund can be processed to the no-show farerules only “.As stated above, actually I requested cancellation and refund toGoToGate 5 days prior to departure date.I do not understand why the Airline recognized my case as ""no show"" ,but I guess there are two possibilities.(1)If GoToGate did not pass my cancellation request through to HahnAir prior to departure date, that is the fault of GoToGate. HenceGoToGate should take responsibility for my refund request.(2)If GoToGate passed my cancellation request through to Hahn Airprior to departure date properly, what Hahn air says is notreasonable.

"Booked a flight on Booking.com (which we love to use!) and did not realize that Booking.com switched us to ""Go to Gate"" (GTG).  The airline cancelled our flight and scheduled us on the next flight AFTER the cancelled flight. We wanted the flight BEFORE the cancelled flight.  We contacted GTG and told them what we wanted.  We know that there are seats available.  Then the problems began.  All of this is on recorded lines.  We were told that GTG would send our request to ""their support team"".  Strange that the agent does not have access to something like SABRE? Consumers should know that the agent you speak with in customer service apparently cannot do anything but send it to ""the support team"" - so do not expect an immediate response.  The agent told us that the support team needed to contact the airline and obtain ""authorization"" to make the requested change.  We subsequently tried to make the change with the airline, and they told us that GTG can make the change immediately and no authorization is needed because there was a flight cancellation. We believe the airline.  GTG told us that the authorization would take 14 business days to arrive from the airline.  We do not believe this either - and the airline agent laughed when we asked if this were true.  The change can be made immediately - it does not take 14 days.  We asked to speak to a supervisor at GTG.  One GTG customer service agent stated ""GTG does not have supervisors"".  We challenged.  Then the story was ""there is no supervisor on duty now"".  We asked to escalate to a senior agent.  We were told there was no one to escalate to, but then the story changed to ""someone would call"".  We asked to be transferred.  Then we were told that a supervisor will call in 48 hours. The story keeps changing.  We gave them a number to call (the number on the reservation was going to be unavailable).  Days later, when we called to check they told us they called the unavailable number - and (surprise!) - it was unavailable.  We asked about a refund.  We were told that the airline would have to Authorize a refund and that they would cancel the current request (we are now waiting FIVE calendar days for the support team to actually process our change) and then restart a new request - and that airline require 15 business days to AUTHORIZE a refund request. (The airline states that if a flight is cancelled refunds are process immediately and NO AUTHORIZATION is needed. So, we are better waiting the additional (apparently MANDATORY 12 more business days). We notice that GTG monitors these postings. How about intervening and process our requested change?UPDATE March 3, 2024After 14 business days they still did not change our reservation and I called.  SURPRISE!  They actually can change reservations without sending it to their support team.  Then I asked for the seat selection I paid for.  They will not assign a seat and will not refund the money.  They stated that if you pay for seats and there is a cancellation the payment for the seats is forfeited.

"On the 23rd of december 2023 Air Europe cancelled my flight. Booking in partnership with GotoGate (company that I used to buy the flight) offered me the posibility of a refund. After accepting the refund. Neither Booking nor Gotogate (same company with different name) updated me with my refund situation. Turns out that, even though, I was notified with the cancelation of my flight by GotoGate, Air Europe did not notified neither Booking nor Gotogate. Anyway, it took them a month (23rd of january) to finally cancelled my flight despite it was them (gotogate and booking) that notified me on the first place.

"I am writing here to express my extreme dissatisfaction and concern regarding the handling of my refund request by Flybillet.dk, related to bookings that have been explicitly authorized for a full refund by LOT airline due to their admitted mistake.Despite multiple confirmations from LOT that no refund request has been made on behalf of my booking—contrary to the information provided by Flybillet.dk, including a supposed e-tracking number and a copy of an email from your customer service—I find your company's actions not only misleading but also ethically questionable. This discrepancy is not only alarming but also indicative of a failure to perform a basic service that has been promised to me as a customer.I have incontrovertible evidence that Flybillet.dk has not only failed to initiate the authorized refund process but has also inappropriately extracted taxes from the tickets and allocated these funds for your own financial benefit without my consent. This action is unauthorized, unacceptable, and I presume, illegal.Your continuous assurance of processing my refund without any actual progress compels me to consider all available legal options to resolve this matter. This includes, but is not limited to, legal proceedings to ensure compliance with the consumer protection laws of Sweden, Denmark, and any other applicable jurisdictions.This situation is wholly unacceptable and demonstrates a blatant disregard for customer rights and corporate responsibility. I urge Flybillet.dk to rectify this matter by processing the full refund for my order and for my partner's, as authorized by LOT airline, without further delay or deceit.Should Flybillet.dk address this issue promptly and satisfactorily, I am willing to reconsider the public airing of this grievance. However, my patience is not limitless, and my commitment to seeking justice in this matter should not be underestimated.I expect an immediate response with a resolution plan that acknowledges the gravity of your company's oversight and outlines steps for rectifying this unacceptable situation.Sincerely,Christian Porsmose StenderPS:I insist on receiving a direct email address and a designated contact person for confidential communication of my booking details—this request comes in light of the serious nature of my complaint and the insufficiency of your current security protocols, which inappropriately depend solely on a booking number and an email for account access, meaning i cannot just put this information here. Let this serve as a clear instruction: do not direct me to your standard customer service line again, as such responses have proven futile and dismissive time and time again.

"I have read several reviews about this company called Go to Gate and I pretty much disregarded the comment of how awful the services they provided to their customers. I was dead wrong for ignoring the warning and reviews of the former customers. The word ""Awful"" service was an understatement!! This company was a JOKE! Here's a quick and dirty event that happened. I bought a ticket from them since their pricing was quite cheap. Time to check in to my flight.. the reference number can't be found even by the airline company. I made a called and was directed to India customer rep... they are charging an extra $16.50 for them to check me in online. What choice do I have but to pay since my flight was in 2 hours. That's not all, my return flight??? oh gee... they canceled a day before my flight for unknown reason. I have to re-booked it again directly with the airline.Lesson learned... Don't even bother booking with them for saving a few bucks.

"This company does not deserve any star. I would urge trading standard, consumer direct or civil aviation to look into this company. It's a scam company which it's not a member of any aviation group. My flight booked in the UK was cancelled in March 2022, (reference LIRRVQ). Since then I sent dozens of emails chasing the refund, but every time the reply was ""Kindly note that we have escalated it to the concerned team"". Most recent email, simply got no reply any more. Same issue in 2023, a ticket purchased through Booking.com without knowing gotogate was the affiliate company. Again it got cancelled with no refund, fortunately this time ticket was purchased by credit card, hence was able to claim it back through credit card company. In addition, this company at that time charged £100 admin fee for two checked luggages (called airline, they actually charge only 8 Euro per luggage), and a unfair term that if flight is cancelled, this fee would not be returned. Guess this is one of the reason that flights booked through this company frequently cancelled. Skyscanner is also failing to carry out KYC check to allow such a scam company appear in their search engine. A quick check online, not difficult to see how many victims are out there. Another friend booked a ticket through booking.com in Thailand last year, had a same issue and yet to receive any refund.A kind advice, stay far away from this company and any its affiliates. Don't purchase ticket from Gotogate! Don't buy ticket through Booking.com as well. Having been using booking.com for years, I now completely stopped any business with them.",1,Negative,company deserve star would urge trading standard consumer direct civil aviation look company scam company member aviation group flight book uk cancel march reference lirrvq since send dozen email chase refund every time reply kindly note escalate concerned team recent email simply get reply issue ticket purchase bookingcom without know gotogate affiliate company get cancel refund fortunately time ticket purchase credit card hence able claim back credit card company addition company time charge admin fee two check luggage call airline actually charge euro per luggage unfair term flight cancel fee would return guess one reason flight book company frequently cancel skyscanner also fail carry kyc check allow scam company appear search engine quick check online difficult see many victim another friend book ticket bookingcom thailand last year issue yet receive refunda kind advice stay far away company affiliate do not purchase ticket gotogate do not buy ticket bookingcom well use bookingcom year completely stop business

Absolute Fraudsters. Cancelled my flights for June this week and as much as they did ask me to confirm if i wanted to cancel... didn't make it clear at all if I cancelled the flight that I would lose 100% of costs... so now £2500 down and as their customer services are outwith the UK their service desk will not and can not help...And edited to add after their ‘copy paste’ reply that is the same for all complaints… just highlights the concerns further that they know they steal your money and don’t care.

I booked flights to Pisa through Booking.com The flight were 4h 55m each way which included a change in London. Somehow Gotogate got involved. I had a message shortly afterwards saying that the connecting flights had changed. The journeys were now taking over 8 hours and 12 hours . I have complained to Booking.com at least three times on the Booking.com phone and on chat saying I wanted my booking cancelled a refund but nothing has been done. Gotogate say in a no reply email that my flights have not changed. Booking.com and British Airways staff say they have. British Airways staff said Gotogate never booked the 4h 55m flights and that the long journeys are the original bookings.When I log into Booking.com it says my original 4h 55m flights are still in place despite the airline saying that is wrong.I have written to addresses I have found asking for this to be sorted. I have heard nothing so far.I have been unalble to contact Gotogate by phone or email.

"I booked a flexible return ticket with Gotogate and decided to change my return date. This became a nightmare.I called a booking.com customer rep by phone to change my return ticket.

She told me that I would receive a confirmation by email for my new booking.24h after I received an email asking me to pay a new extra fee ̈́'as ̈́'fare hike''that was never mentionned before.I refused to pay this unlawful fare hike. I sent an email as response arguing:""As a company selling products to customers, you must inform your client of the price they have to pay so that they can make their decision. Once the agreement is made on the price and payment is done, the price can't be changed afterwards.""My email was left unanswered.I started an online chat with the customer support. He answered that he understood the situation but didn't have the power to cancel the extra fee. I asked him to speak to a supervisor and to send me a copy of the chat I had with him. He said we would send it and I would receive a phone call from a supervisor. None of these engagements were respected.I called customer service again, this time by phone. I asked the customer rep to speak to a supervisor. He checked my file, saw that a request for a call back had been lodged and assured me that a supervisor would call me back ASAP.I've never received this call.When I started to do my check-in online for my flight happening the following day, I couldn't do it without paying the extra fare which I was never informed about. I was forced to pay it in order to board my plane.The story gets worse...When I tried to do my online check-in 24h before my return trip, my ticket still appeared as scheduled for the initial date. Not only they forced me to pay a hidden fee, but they didn't even bother changing the booking after I had paid it!!!I chatted one more time with your customer support online. The person assured me the modification would be done and I would receive my plane ticket within 3hrs max. I explained how important it was to me in order to prepare my trip to the airport to receive it ASAP. 5hrs later, I still hadn't received the plane ticket. It was not even visible on your website!!! I called back and the customer rep assured me I would receive it on time for my plane. He couldn't even give me the departure hour.I never received it no more that I received any message from the customer rep service which was one more time useless on chat and unaccountable for their engagementsThis whole practice of increasing the price afterwards and putting me in a position in which I am forced to pay or to lose my whole flight was unlawful. Not even making sure that the change of booking had been made, or being able to give me information on my reservation was unprofessional. Of the various engagements taken by the 5 customer reps I talked to, none of them were respected. All together this was purely and simply bad customer practices at best.

"I booked a round trip flight from Vietnam to Koh Samui via booking.com because I just had good experiences with hotel bookings, so I thought let's give a flight booking a try.A decision I will forever reget, I have never experienced such a bad customer service before. 1 week prior to the departure gotogate.com informed me that the return flight was not possible anymore because of a change in the airline timetable. I was given the choice between a cancellation and the confirmation of a suggested alternative. I immediately confirmed the alternative and got the response from gotogate that they requested the reservation but needed the confirmation from the airline. I never heard from gotogate again, until I reached out proactively to them a few days prior to the day of the flight. What followed then was just the worst. They told me every day (only when I reached out, they didn't contact me from their end) that I will for sure get the confirmation within the 24 next hours. But I never got anything. And every day, instead of enjoying my vacation, I contacted them via chat again to  get an update and they just realized every time that the alternative they should book for me was now not available anymore. So they offered a new one - which the airline would need to confirm. So we were running in circles, going through the same process again and again. I was stranded on Koh Samui and in the end I then when they offered me a new alternative again (meanwhile multiple days later than the orginal one) I chose cancellation instead of confirmation of the alternative and booked a completely new flight on my own for immediate depature.I have to add they had stopped responding via chat or email days before and my boyfriend in Europe had to call them because I didn't want to spend a fortune on phone calls from Thailand.That was in March 2023. Ever since I have seen no money. I have written them around 10 times for an updates, getting always they same reply ""we are still waiting for the authorization of the aireline, we will refund you as soon as the request has been approved"".I'm not sure if they are actually criminal and have received the money already of if they just refuse to do their job to get my money back. I am sure I will never see my money and even if I ask for an update in 10 years they will write that they are still waiting for the authorization.I will try to involve a lawyer to make sure they don't get away with it.What makes me the most angry is that I would still sit on the island if I hadn't contacted them all the time. They just ignore their customers, they don't care if the flight alternative they requested is never confirmed, they don't care at all and give standard answers and promises that are completely stupid and wrong.",1,Negative,book round trip flight vietnam koh samui via bookingcom good experience hotel booking think let give flight booking trya decision forever reget never experience bad customer service week prior departure gotogatecom inform return flight possible anymore change airline timetable give choice cancellation confirmation suggest alternative immediately confirm alternative get response gotogate request reservation need confirmation airline never hear gotogate reach proactively day prior day flight follow worst tell every day reach do not contact end sure get confirmation within next hour never get anything every day instead enjoy vacation contact via chat get update realize every time alternative book available anymore offer new one airline would need confirm running circle go process strand koh samui end offer new alternative meanwhile multiple day later orginal one choose cancellation instead confirmation alternative book completely new flight immediate depaturei add stop respond via chat email day boyfriend europe call do not want spend fortune phone call thailandthat march ever since see money write around time update getting always reply still wait authorization aireline refund soon request approvedim sure actually criminal receive money already refuse job get money back sure never see money even ask update year write still wait authorizationi try involve lawyer make sure do not get away itwhat make angry would still sit island have not contact time ignore customer do not care flight alternative request never confirm do not care give standard answer promise completely stupid wrong

"This is the worst company on earth. My flight was cancelled in February 2023. Until today they haven’t gave my my money back despite multiple calls, requesting call from managers….nothing. I decided to go through my credit company and got my money back from them. So now they will deal with the lying scammers. For months they were blaming that the airline didn’t refund them money but I did my own investigation and I had email from the airline saying they gave them my money back 8days after my application for cancelled flight was accepted. Essentially, 6 days after my flight was cancelled (in February 2023). They still telling me they didn’t get money from the airline!!!!This company is a scam!

The other 2 tickets on the other reservation took 3 years and a laywer to get our money back. The first 2,5 years, we tried ourselves, and we were sent on a wild goose chase by booking.com, gotogate and  etraveli (who owns gotogate). We finally got fed up, took a laywer about 6 months ago.

"Whilst Gotogate appears to have competitive prices be VERY careful when booking. The prices are low purely to come up at the top of searches on travel booking sites.

They charged £26.99 for this although on the airline's own site (Air Asia) they only charge £10.24 (THB 468)This is an over charge/mark-up of 260%When I phoned GotoGate they said that they are entitled to mark up their prices, that I had chosen to add the luggage and that they do not give refunds of any kind on the extras that they sell as part of the bookings.

"Beware the gotogate bag charge ripoff. I looked at a flight with Norwegian Air on gotogate. On Norwegian's website they will charge you extra for check-in baggage but if you pay that, you also get an overhead luggage bag included in that fee. On Gotogate they have the same extra fee for check-in baggage but then they wanted to charge an extra $34 for each overhead luggage bag.

The booking experience was very easy and all confirmation came via email promptly following the booking completion. I was little sceptical at first booking using an unknown travel site via Skyscanner but Gotogate lived up to its price promise with no hidden charges or extras unless you chose to select it during the booking process.

"If I could give -10 Stars I definetly would. Gotogate is the absolute worst and I would 100% advise against booking with Gotogate. On July 28th I have booked a flight. On October 8th I was informed via email by Gotogate that my flight was cancelled and that they would take care of the refund. Until today, I have not received my money back. After hours and hours, days and days, discussing with Gotogate Customer Service, where, honestly, one employee is more incompetent than the other, still nothing. Reasons why Gotogate Customer Service is the worst:- NONE of the phone numbers work, so you are forced to connect with an employee via chat- Every time you connect via chat you wait for approximately an hour to speak with a new employee that understands nothing about your case and tries to finish the ticket as fast as possible by giving you wrong and, well, unhelpful information. - You cannot speak to a superior, you have no direct contact person responsible for your case, you are simply pushed around. - The employees working at customer service have no idea about the cases they are working in. They continously give out wrong information because they do not read the file carefully. In many cases it was obvious that they were lying to try and get rid of me. - The employees working at customer service left the chat multiple times in the middle of the conversation, so that I had to start all over again. After months of logging in to the chat weekly and after a while daily, I was finally contacted by Gotogate by phone, as I had asked for from the beginning. Yogesh - apparently a dispute resolution employee - admitted to me that Gotagate made a mistake, as they cancelled a flight that was not refundable and was actually not cancelled by the airline. While first admitting that the mistake was clearly made by gotogate, he started haggling. First, he said we would only receive 10% of the ticket price. Then he tried to raise it to 50% and after a very onerous conversation I made clear to him that there was no legal basis for them to refund lass than 100% of the paid price. He then promised me that my refund would be confirmed within two days. That was two weeks ago and, again, I have not heard back from Gotogate. I am back at my routine, where I have to spend hours talking to employees who do not have information about my case, send me standard phrases, having the audacity to ask me to be patient, promising call-backs that never happen and so on. I will now proceed to write bad reviews in every homepage where Gotogate is known, because honestly no one deserves to be treated like Gotogate treats its customers.

"Customers of the excellent Booking.com should beware that booking flights through that system are directed through Gotogate. But Gotogate (a separate company) have an unreliable online booking system, and a communication system that cannot be trusted. For example, errors never showed up because email confirmations never gave the full complete details of the passengers on the booking. Their system made a mistake by missing off a surname, which meant that the airline would not book a passenger in when checking in at the airport. Leading to great extra cost for new flight. Gotogate staff were unsympathetic (and cut us off during a phone call from a foreign country) and have refused to refund the costs. A pity that Booking.com have linked themselves to such a company.

I refused and called the airline that confirmed they did not cancel the leg but that the travel agent must have made changes.

"Flight time got changed multiple times (not their fault) and on the third change it was considerably earlier and I could no longer make that flight. I called then to cancel the flight within flight rules. I was told after waiting on hold for 1.5hrs that they would process it and it would take 5-10 working days. I then booked a replacement flight for my trip. After 10 days I had heard nothing from them, so I called back (2hrs on hold) to be told it was in process. 5 more days pass… I look online and see there should be a confirmation email of the refund being processed; I had not received one. So I called again.2.5hrs on hold!!! Was told it was in process. I called a total of 12 times because I was not receiving confirmation of the cancelled booking. The last time I called was 1 week before the flight, where I was explicitly told that it was all in process and that the airline had a backlog of up to 13 weeks and that was why I had not received any emails because they were waiting for the reply from them, but that I shouldn't worry the flight time is approaching as my application was put in previously… I wait 15 weeks. Still nothing. Call again, about a the refund. They say they will look into it… I then receive an email for refund application for a no show for a flight…I call them about this. End up escalating all the way to managers. Who simply apologised and said it was too late to process the refund.So basically, despite calling 12 times and speaking to different people each time; nobody even processed the cancellation due to flight time change.Over £600 it cost me having to pay for 2 flights; feel absolutely tricked in a long con. Of course because of the elapsed weeks, I couldn’t go through the credit card company. And when I requested transcripts of our calls, they omitted the calls where it was stated explicitly that I would receive a refund, and only sent the calls where it was ‘implied’.Meaning I couldn’t take it further.

"Once again, we have been saved by the amazing support of Singapore Airlines for providing my friend with an alternative within the same day. Thank you for that :)In the past, I wrote a post/story about our horrible experience with the ""Etraveli Group Supersaver/GotoGate"" Well, guess what? It's still as horrible as usual, and the reviews aren't lying either. Isn't it a sign from the customer to do something to improve your customer experience?So, I have booked several tickets on Booking.com (without knowing their partnership with GoToGate) from Amsterdam to Ho Chi Minh City for a few friends of mine. The departure date would be the 30th of January, arriving on the 31st in Ho Chi Minh City. However, there was a certain flight from ""Singapore to Ho Chi Minh City"" that didn't meet the requirements with a minimum layover of at least 1 hour and 30 minutes. Therefore, action was required from our beloved travel agency, but they came up with this unreasonable proposal:Please find the alternative option below:Mon, 29 Jan - SQ323Departing: Amsterdam (AMS) at 10:25Arriving: Singapore Changi (SIN) at 05:55Wed, 31 Jan - SQ8536Departing: Singapore Changi (SIN) at 07:20Arriving: Ho Chi Minh City (SGN) at 08:30Yeah right... While all my other friends had another proposal:Mon, 30 Jan - SQ323Departing: Amsterdam (AMS) at 10:25Arriving: Singapore Changi (SIN) at 05:55Wed, 31 Jan - SQ178Departing: Singapore Changi (SIN) at 09:50Arriving: Ho Chi Minh City (SGN) at 11:00When looking on their website Booking.com and GoToGate, there were many alternative flights remaining that day, like the one proposed to my friend. But yeah, their laziness won't end here because we received the following email from ""etraveli/supersaver/gotogate or whatever you want to call them"":""Please be informed that as per Singapore Airlines' schedule change policy, we can rebook the passengers only on the same fare type originally booked.Kindly note we rechecked the availability, and since the preferred flight does not have the same type of fare available, we are unable to rebook you on your preferred flight; the only option available is the one offered to you, which is also subject to seat availability.We request you kindly reply with your preferred selection from the two alternatives offered in the initial email so that we can proceed further with your request, or you can contact the airline directly to check about the available flight options.""Of course, blame it on Singapore Airlines again, even though they were the ones who were 'ABLE' to correctly change that particular flight to a reasonable one, and yes the fare type was the same.After all these years, they still want you to contact the airline directly because they are incapable of fixing it themselves.So, still, my advice is (still): Avoid the Etraveli Group at all costs. Buy from Singapore Airlines or any airline directly. I would rather pay 10% more for a ticket than have a bad customer experience.",1,Negative,save amazing support singapore airline provide friend alternative within day thank past write poststory horrible experience etraveli group supersavergotogate well guess still horrible usual review be not lie either be not sign customer something improve customer experienceso book several ticket bookingcom without know partnership gotogate amsterdam ho chi minh city friend mine departure date would th january arrive st ho chi minh city however certain flight singapore ho chi minh city do not meet requirement minimum layover least hour minute therefore action require beloved travel agency come unreasonable proposalplease find alternative option belowmon jan sqdeparting amsterdam am arrive singapore changi sin we d jan sqdeparte singapore changi sin arrive ho chi minh city sgn yeah right friend another proposalmon jan sqdeparting amsterdam am arrive singapore changi sin we d jan sqdeparte singapore changi sin arrive ho chi minh city sgn look website bookingcom gotogate many alternative flight remain day like one propose friend yeah laziness will not end receive follow email etravelisupersavergotogate whatever want call themplease inform per singapore airlines schedule change policy rebook passenger fare type originally bookedkindly note rechecked availability since preferred flight type fare available unable rebook prefer flight option available one offer also subject seat availabilitywe request kindly reply preferred selection two alternative offer initial email proceed request contact airline directly check available flight optionsof course blame singapore airline even though one able correctly change particular flight reasonable one yes fare type sameafter year still want contact airline directly incapable fix themselvesso still advice still avoid etraveli group cost buy singapore airlines airline directly would rather pay ticket bad customer experience

When I got to airport my original booking was still live and the amended name change was put on as an additional traveler but as a diplomat which obviously caused problems as I wasn't spent 1hr 20 mins at checkin trying to get it sorted then there was a mad dash to get family through security and onto flight in 40 mins.,1,Negative,book online via skyscanner website go gate cheap price jump checkout cancel start price skyscanner still jump checkout go back next day price still book jump timei book use name frank francis spot mistake call second pay card girl phone do not even book make could not correct name ask call back next day do charge change name get airport original booking still live amend name change put additional traveler diplomat obviously cause problem be not spend hr min checkin try get sort mad dash get family security onto flight min

"Absolutely disgusting company that I will never even look at again. Terrible customer service, impossible to speak to anyone that can access any useful information other than reading the scripts. I booked flight tickets with them in March 2022, which got cancelled by Lufthansa. Gotogate sent me a text and an email about the cancellation and didn't do anything further whatsoever. I had to reschedule flights by myself directly with Lufthansa, but one of the connection flights was cancelled again by Lufthansa, which left me no other options other than cancelling the whole trip in the end. Lufthansa paid Gotogate the full amount of my flight refund, but Gotogate did not inform me nor transferred the money to me. Everytime I rang Gotogate or emailed them, all I got from them was repeated answers that my tickets were non-refundable. Lufthansa was also useless helping me. My battle with Gotogate is over now, I contacted my credit card company and sorted the money refund with them. However, it was absolutely disappointing and disgusting experience with Gotogate. 100% dishonest and irresponsible company who wants your money but is not interested in providing a quality service. What stunned me more is that this company has been around with this attitude for sometime now and nobody in the company (I contacted many people in the senior management of Gotogate, and of course they simply ignored) gives shi*.",1,Negative,absolutely disgusting company never even look terrible customer service impossible speak anyone access useful information read script book flight ticket march get cancel lufthansa gotogate send text email cancellation do not anything whatsoever reschedule flight directly lufthansa one connection flight cancel lufthansa leave option cancel whole trip end lufthansa pay gotogate full amount flight refund gotogate inform transfer money everytime rang gotogate email get repeat answer ticket nonrefundable lufthansa also useless help battle gotogate contact credit card company sort money refund however absolutely disappointing disgusting experience gotogate dishonest irresponsible company want money interested provide quality service stun company around attitude sometime nobody company contact many people senior management gotogate course simply ignore give shi

"When I searched for flights, I found that this company had the cheapest prices, but their customer service is terrible. If you need a ticket for a specific date and want to avoid any uncertainty, this company may work for you. However, reaching out to them only offers two options: a 24/7 chat or a phone call. The phone call option involves waiting in a queue for hours, while the chat connects you to someone in under 30 minutes, but after about 15 minutes of waiting. The chat service they use does not provide notifications when an agent is connected, so if you switch to another tab while waiting, you may find that the chat has been disconnected when you return.

"Booked a flight from Pittsburgh, PA to Lancaster, PA for my daughter during the Thanksgiving holidays and after she sat in the airport for more than five hours, Southern Airways Express cancelled the flight.  We have been trying to get a refund for more than six weeks now and Gotogate keeps saying they are trying to get a refund from Southern Airways Express, and it's apparent they don't refund until if/when the airlines refunds them even though the flight was cancelled.  You'd think this is a no-brainer for customer service and good business practices, but it isn't.  We finally filed a dispute with our credit card company, but lost the dispute because of Gotogate's Terms and Conditions.  We obviously didn't read the full T&C, but buried in 12.2 and 12.3 it states ""...we can only refund payments where we have already received such from the applicable Service Provider"".  In this case Southern Airways Express.  Just beware that there is a high degree of risk that you won't get a refund from Gotogate if the flight is cancelled by the airline.

"I work as a scientist at a Swedish university and often travel for conferences, usually purchasing tickets directly from the airline. However, due to positive experiences with booking accommodations through booking.com, I decided to try booking a flight through them as well. On November 7th, I bought a flight ticket via booking.com (Reference number 40-433341504). Realizing an error in the date immediately, I canceled the booking and made a new purchase. I contacted booking.com to explain the situation. They informed me they were requesting a full refund from the airline, a process typically taking 7 to 10 business days.After this period, I reached out to booking.com's live chat and telephone support, learning that the airline had not responded to their refund request, and they couldn't confirm the refund duration. When I directly contacted the airline, The airline has explicitly stated that they have not received any payment and have not issued any tickets, thus indicating that there is no refundable transaction available. I promptly informed booking.com via email and phone. However, they claimed the airline was unresponsive and couldn't provide a refund timeline. It has been two months already, and they still don't know when they can issue the refund, continuing to claim that the airline is unresponsive.During a conversation with booking.com customer care, an officer named MAJA stated, ""Please wait for this message before contacting us regarding this issue again, as it may affect your place in the queue."" I found this concerning, and I consider this flight reservation company affiliated with booking.com to be engaging in fraudulent behavior. I've already warned all my university friends and colleagues against booking tickets through booking.com or SWEDISH gotogate.

"Hi Guys, I have booked a flight ticket from gotogate recently from pattaya to Bangkok. However, after going though the comments, I am little nervous.

I have called 3 times to gotogate customer care, but everytime, ""they say your voice is not audable and they simply cut the line"". If this is genuine ticket, I just want the e-ticket with barcode from the official airways. I would request e-ticket from gotogate to prove me wrong.-- after few days of booking, I reached to the customer care of Bangkok airways.Luckily, the bookings were correct, but the booking reference number provided by Gotogate was wrong, so the bookings were not visible on official bangkok air site. When I requested to search with name, then the bookings were appeared with different booking reference number. Such a buggy site or gotogate intentionally giving wrong airline booking reference number so that you can pay for the checkin fee.

I have first used the messenger support with gotogate, fruitlessly and since that I have called 16 times during the past three weeks, without a resolution. We now still don't know if we can go, and the solution so far suggested is to reebook to a day where we cant go or get a full refund - but then everything is out the window.  We only need one corresponding flight rebooked.

"Jan 15: Issue solved! It took almost 7 weeks and immense pressure from our legal advisor, the Skyscanner support team and myself! NEVER AGAIN!Jan 6:Received another payment request. Replied and explained that the error is on their side and that it was fixed for our friends free of charge. Waiting again now.Jan 3:It's been over 5 weeks. Received 2 emails with the same invalid tickets. And another email 15 minutes later with a link to pay over 656€ !!! to change the tickets. And another email 5 minutes later asking me to ignore the first emails and another link to pay 656€ !!! Replied and explained that the error is on their side and that it was fixed for our friends free of charge. Waiting again now. The claim with the European Consumer Centre is open now and a lawyer has reached out to GTG.Dec 23:Received an email with the same invalid tickets. Called in again, explained again, waiting again...Dec 18:Wow! This is not for the faint of heart. I wanted to add a star because finally our friend's issue was solved and their daughter now has an adult ticket that Japan Airlines confirmed she can travel on. But then I compared my son's new tickets and her's and realized that my sons still have a CHILD ticket! All GTG did was change the title from ""Mstr"" to ""Mr"". Japan Airlines confirmed that they cannot travel with these tickets. Called in again, explained again, waiting again...Dec 16:I am taking away a star again since the issue is still not solved for our friends. They received another message today re asking them to pay for the change of ticket even though the error is not on their side and our change of ticket was done for free. Just called in again and gave them all the information AGAIN! This agent didn’t see the other agent’s note from Thursday! What on earth?Dec 14:I received an email with a confirmation that my change request has been closed but without any details or tickets attached so I called them and they forwarded me the tickets. My kids have been booked under a different PNR but they show as adults now. Our friends' change request is still stuck but the agent explained that since the passport shows the middle name of their daughter which they didn't enter during the booking (middle names are not mandatory) GTG asked for the name change and the fee. He escalated the case and finally linked both requests together. I have to admit that this agent was extremely efficient, patient and throrough (the first one since I started calling and chatting 2 weeks ago). Big shout out to him! I am adding a star for this. Now waiting for the change to happen for our friends and we should be able to close that nerve-wracking chapter!!Dec 12: It's been 2 weeks. Our friends and myself have sent in our children's passports as requested by GTG. I haven't received any feedback. Our friends received an email today asking them to pay 190€ plus 40€ fee for changing their daughter's NAME on the ticket!! Wow, just wow. Called them back and they apologised and promised to fix it. I opened a claim with the European Consumer Centre to get legal assistance now.Dec 5: It's been a week. Our friends received a call from GTG asking them to look at their emails and immediately hanging up. No email so they had to contact them to ask for a resend. The email asks to send their daughter's passport for a name change. I guess it's a standard text. Passport sent by email, now waiting again. I didnt' receive anything, no call, no email so I contacted them and they sent an email asking for my son's passports. Sent them and now waiting again.Dec 1: Still waiting for a solution. It's been 4 days. I have been contacting GtG daily but there has been no progress. I have been asked to wait and nobody can tell me how long.Nov 27:I booked a return flight from Frankfurt to Tokyo with Japan Airlines through GTG for myself and my family. Through some weird system error, my 2 teenage sons have been booked as children even though I entered the correct dates of birth during the booking process. They both now have an invalid child ticket and Japan Airlines confirmed they will not be able to board as they need an adult ticket. Our friends who booked the same itinerary have the same issue with their daughter’s ticket. We opened claims with the GtG customer service who confirmed they have escalated them to the department in charge but they are unable to provide a date for this to be resolved. Between our 2 families we have spent over 9000€ so this situation is more than stressful! We actually tried to simulate a booking by entering our kids as adult passengers and the GtG system will not even allow that! It triggers an error message saying adult passengers need to be 18 and over! I sincerely hope GtG will resolve that issue in a timely manner and with no extra charge.

"Worst customer service - Do not recommend I booked flights for 4 people from London to Johannesburg on the 24th of November 2023, I made an error with one of the passenger names in which i called in within minutes of making the reservation to amend. The consultant said best thing to do was to cancel that passenger off and re book. He explained there would be a penalty of £34.99 and said refunds are done with in 2 weeks. I got an e mail to confirm all of this. After 3 weeks still no refund I called in and basically keep getting the same story it is on the priority list and will be sorted within 72 hours. I am now 6 weeks in and still no refund , I keep getting excuses no manager will speak to me and I am still unable to rebook the passenger that was cancelled as I am still awaiting my £861.49. I find this kind of service disturbing and nauseating as go to gate are sitting with my money and refuse to process. My next step is go legal as they are not moving forward.

"First, I’d like to recommend all the viewers of this to never book through booking.com. If you need assistance, you will be on your own! It is a stressful path of agony and suffering that have ruined my New Year’s Eve. Sunday (New Year’s Eve) I have a flight from Copenhagen to Malaga with Swiss Airlines that I bought through Booking.com. Thursday, I realised a mistake in my name on my flight. Thus I immediately called customer support, who directed me to the airline. Then when I called the airline, I was informed that this was the responsibility of booking.com.I reached out to booking.com (again), They let me know that it was possible to change the name indeed, however I had to pay an extra fee. They sent me a link (via gotogate) and I paid this fee. I waited half a day, then they called after figuring out that due to having included my frequent flyer ID the name change was not possible, therefore I had to pay the difference in price for a new ticket and thus I had to pay a higher fee. I complied. Friday I called them to get an update and I was told that the name change was in process, but they would not specify how long it would take. I called them again, I was told I needed to pay yet another fee and they would send a link - at this point I decided that they probably was not going to be able to do the change. A few hours later I tried to access the link but it had expired. I called them again and was told they would send me another link, but she could not tell me when it would come nor if I was able to make my upcoming flight on Sunday - she just told me that I should call them again in a few hours. When I called them again, I was told the complete opposite by the customer service worker - he said that the payment had  been processed and only the last technicalities. I asked him why his colleagues had told me the opposite before, he said he was sorry and that it would all be okay. I just had to wait and call in again. I asked him to get in writing what he had told me, which he refused. He could not give me any time frame, but simply told me to wait. I went to sleep and this morning woke up to an email from booking.com. They wrote they had been calling me diligently and due to the flight being in 24 hours, and they were unable to get hold of me to confirm the name change, they would not be able to do this. They mentioned they would refund the extra fees I had paid. Furthermore, they tell me to contact the airline directly, but when doing this, I am informed that Booking.com has cancelled my ticket. Thus, I have paid for a product and extra fees that I haven’t received. To sum up: their costumer service workers are puppets that cannot provide any real information. I request anyone not to believe any word they’re saying as they are not there to help you but there to shut you up and get done with the case. Furthermore, they cannot provide any real customer services and they try to wash their hands clean by saying they call “diligently.” Now, I have wasted three days of trying to sort my problem out, all while they should’ve told me in the beginning it wasn’t possible instead of explaining the inability being due to me missing in action. Furthermore, they have cancelled my ticket (that I have paid for and that they won’t refund) in the process, so I can’t even try to correct the errors myself.",1,Negative,first I d like recommend viewer never book bookingcom need assistance stressful path agony suffering ruin new year eve sunday new year eve flight copenhagen malaga swiss airline buy bookingcom thursday realise mistake name flight thus immediately call customer support direct airline call airline inform responsibility bookingcomi reach bookingcom let know possible change name indeed however pay extra fee send link via gotogate pay fee wait half day call figure due include frequent flyer i d name change possible therefore pay difference price new ticket thus pay high fee comply friday call get update tell name change process would specify long would take call tell needed pay yet another fee would send link point decide probably go able change hour later try access link expired call tell would send another link could tell would come able make upcoming flight sunday tell call hour call tell complete opposite customer service worker say payment process last technicality ask colleague tell opposite say sorry would okay wait call ask get writing tell refuse could give time frame simply tell wait go sleep morning wake email bookingcom write call diligently due flight hour unable get hold confirm name change would able mention would refund extra fee pay furthermore tell contact airline directly inform bookingcom cancel ticket thus pay product extra fee have not receive sum costumer service worker puppet provide real information request anyone believe word they re say help shut get do case furthermore provide real customer service try wash hand clean say call diligently waste three day try sort problem should ve tell beginning be not possible instead explain inability due miss action furthermore cancel ticket pay will not refund process can not even try correct error
"ORDER NUMBER: 40-395579334NEVER book a fly ticket with Gotogate. It was my first time and I didn't know Booking was partner with Gotogate. Usually I book on Expedia and Ebookers and there is never a problem. Due to the war I had to cancel my business class ticket from Tel Aviv to Cairo via Amman worth USD 950. I could cancel for free (Royal Air Jordan policy) but Gotogate take upfront USD 150 to cancel. AND...I called and wrote at least ten times and they won't give me my money back. When you speak to them eventually, after many cut lines while waiting for hours on the phone, they have a foreign accent and their English is not clear, and they anyway keep repeating the will send my money back once they get it from the airline. They even told me to call the airlines directly...which I did but they won't talk to me as I did not book through them. And GOTOGATE knows that. My friends booked same ticket via a travel agency and have been refunded THE DAY AFTER. So I am sure GotoGate HAVE RECEIVED the refund from the airline. They know that they can hold the money in their account before sending it back to my credit card, It pays actually around 5% so it a good income.

NEVER USE THIS SERVICEWe bought our tickets via this app and when we arrived to the airport it turned out that our reservation was canceled (we were not notified about it) because Gotogate didn’t transfer the money to our airline. When we contacted the customer service of Gotogate they told us that we must have received a refund (which we did not receive and the money was booked from our account). So we needed to buy new tickets without a refund being made and turned out to be in an absolutely uncomfortable situation. Please only buy your tickets directly from the airlines you are flying with.

"Flight search through Kayak.co.uk came up with a flight ticket which was suitable for me. It showed three options. Gotogate, Booking.com and somethingelse. As the reviews for GotoGate are not great, I opted to book through Booking.com. It showed that 3 tickets are availble at 10.30 in the morning. I tried to book at 3 pm. There was only one ticket left. I filled in all information and attempted card payment. Towards the end of this exercise, I saw a message that the booking has failed and I should try again. There is still one ticket available. I tried again and this time it went through.  I had several emails from Booking.com and it also said that the actual booking was done through GotoGate, which their sister company. After four days, incidentally I was checking my credit card transactions, wherein I was charged twice for the flight ticket by Booking.com. I am disgusted that:Their system wrongly displayed a message that I should try again, even when the booking has actually gone through. I have a doubt that they are practicing cheap tricks to extract money from customers, and especially taking advantage of non-returnable tickets.Their website is fraudulent. They give wrong messages and compell customers to book again. The available number of tickets shown by their system is also a fraud. When one ticket was shown as available, if the booking has gone through all right, how can it show the number of available ticket as one again?In the end, after 24 hours of banging my head against a wall, they came up with a solution to cancel one of the bookings, after charging a penalty of £255. Inefficient systems, inaccessible customer service, Fraudulant messages on the system...All this costed me £255. Rubbish website.

"Utterly Disappointed: Avoid GoToGate at All Costs!I regret to say that my recent encounter with GoToGate has left me seething with frustration and disappointment. I purchased flight tickets through their platform, intending to include our newborn baby in the booking. Shockingly, their ineptitude and lack of communication with the airline prevented them from making this seemingly straightforward adjustment. Unbelievable!When I attempted to rectify this, their customer service proved to be an absolute nightmare. Not only did they fail to assist in adding our baby to the booking, but their refusal to provide a full refund was the final straw. It's appalling that a company supposedly facilitating travel couldn't manage such a simple request and then had the audacity to deny a reasonable refund.Communication? Non-existent. Support? Abysmal. Transparency? Completely lacking. GoToGate's disregard for customer needs is utterly appalling. What's worse is their attempt to swindle customers with additional charges when alterations are necessary. It's beyond comprehension how a company can operate with such disregard for customer satisfaction.Save yourself the anguish and avoid GoToGate. The allure of cheaper prices quickly fades away when you're confronted with their incompetence and their readiness to exploit customers. My experience has been a cautionary tale, and I implore anyone considering their services to steer clear and opt for a more reputable and customer-centric alternative.

"Gotogate is a legitimate business in which they offer one of the better pricing available for your flights. If no problem arises in which you need to change flights or ask for customer service, then it is great. However, when problems do happen, the customer service is horrendous. For expensive and long flights, may be best to avoid them if problems arise as they won't help you as much. Due to my heart condition I had to postpone the flight the same day. The chat is not available 24/7 as they say. My flight was 9pm and I started trying to use the chat at 6am and no one came. A couple hours later, I tried again. I had to wait 30 minutes for someone and when that person came, the rep wasn't helpful. It took me another 3 tries and spent 2 hours waiting for them to help me. By then it was 1pm. The last rep charged ~$100 for airline flight change and another ~$45 for their service fee. The charge was immediate and yet they did not submit the request til 7pm, which is past the airline's cutoff time.

"Three years, I've been waiting to get refunded. During COVID my flight got cancelled. Airliners (and ticket providers) were legally required to refund passengers for these events during this time. The airliner even guaranteed money returns. But ordering it via FlyBillet means they will have to process it. I've called and emailed, over a dozen times. Emails get unanswered, and my phone calls I'm being put in hold for one or two hours only to hear ""are you still here? I'll need to ask my boss"" , to which they just hand the phone to their next colleague who says they'll process it and you'll receive an email.Emails which I never receive, nor the refunds.Stop using an Indian call center whose KPIs rely solely on how fast they close tickets.

Ever since I have been waiting for the refund. I have reached gotogate customer service serval time, just to speak to a new customer service agent who had no clue what was spoken with their previous colleague (no case notes). Which so far resulted in no refund. Each time, I have been told that refund is pending with Airline which is yet to be cleared. Once cleared from Airlines you will receive refund, the customer service only manage the Airlines tickets and do not deals with refunds(it is deal with different backend team which cannot be reach out by the customers).

Spoke with a customer service agent called Ritesh about rebooking a flight.Booked via booking.com and it seems somehow the booking in the background gets made via gotogate. 1. First time I called after about 40 mins on hold the agent cannot find a price for flight change2. Second time explain the whole thing and again and mid-call it disconnects3. Call again third time and speak with an agent. First of all he struggles to understand a simple request like change a flight from date x to y and give me a price. A few times he gets months confused (someone in company needs to listen to recording of phone call). Finally tells me can't find the same flight - guess what I'm live on both the airline website  and gotogate and same flight available for all 3 date options I gave him. He can't explain why can't get the same flight even though it is clearly available to book both via their website and airline website for the same date4. Offers me an inferior route with over 12 hours layover for guess what around 2.8x the price at which I can buy a brand new ticket!! 5. When I say look I can buy a brand new ticket for almost 1/3rd the price you date change - he tells me that ticket pricing is dynamic and changes by the minute. I tell him yes but I'm seeing live prices on your website and the airline - he just repeats it is dynamic pricing6. Ask if I can speak with someone else - puts me on hold and says no one available7. When I ask can I then somehow complain so the case gets looked at - he says send email. I ask what email address - says you can find it on website but I will not give you the email address!!I'm not expecting a free change of date and fully well expect to pay any fare difference but it cannot be almost 2.8 times what a brand new ticket will cost me.,1,Negative,speak customer service agent call ritesh rebooking flightbooke via bookingcom seems somehow book background get make via gotogate first time call min hold agent find price flight change second time explain whole thing midcall disconnect call third time speak agent first struggle understand simple request like change flight date x give price time get month confused someone company need listen record phone call finally tell can not find flight guess I m live airline website gotogate flight available date option give can not explain can not get flight even though clearly available book via website airline website date offer inferior route hour layover guess around x price buy brand new ticket say look buy brand new ticket almost rd price date change tell ticket pricing dynamic change minute tell yes I m see live price website airline repeat dynamic pricing ask speak someone else put hold say one available ask somehow complain case get look say send email ask email address say find website give email addressim expect free change date fully well expect pay fare difference almost time brand new ticket cost

Do not use this company to book your flight. I had used them as i thought it was the same quality service as booking.com however GOTOGATE is terrible.A month before my flight i had received an email that the airline had rescheduled a part of my flight and I was to either accept the change or request a refund. I went on to accept the change. I waited 2 weeks and still hadn't received my new ticket. As time was going I called GOTOGATE for an update they said they were in communication with the airline about my case and will issue me a ticket as soon as they got authorisation. They requested i wait - which i did. But then a week to my flight still nothing. On the last week I called everyday and was given the same instructions. 2 days before my flight they apologised and said all they could do is give me a refund as there were no more seats on the flight I had booked on. This refund would be issued in 10 working days which didn't help as I needed to fly in 2 days. I refused and got transferred. Upon speaking to someone else they managed to get me the e-ticket number - logged onto the airline website and booked a seat. I got confirmation of my flight 1 day before my flight !! This was solely down to my refusal to get off the phone until i got my ticketOn a separate booking (same trip) My brother got on the first plane to the first destination but whilst we were there they cancelled the second flight to the second destination without communication.

"My experience with Gotogate, through a booking with Booking.com, was highly disappointing. I had two flights, reference numbers 40-426610651 for a trip on 22/12 and 40-426599407 for a trip on 03/01. When a refund was necessary for boarding tax and extra luggage, my dealings with Booking.com, starting 11/12, were filled with empty assurances and no effective resolution.Further inquiries with the airline revealed differing responsibilities for refunds: the airline for the first trip and Booking.com for the second. Despite this clarity, Booking.com’s handling of the situation over 10 days was marked by poor communication and a lack of satisfactory response.This ordeal leads me to strongly discourage using Booking.com or Gotogate for flight bookings. The inefficiency and frustrating customer service for issues related to ticketing are stark contrasts to their competence in hotel bookings, suggesting a significant area for improvement in their flight booking services.",1,Negative,experience gotogate booking bookingcom highly disappointing two flight reference number trip trip refund necessary boarding tax extra luggage dealing bookingcom starting fill empty assurance effective resolutionfurther inquiry airline reveal differ responsibility refund airline first trip bookingcom second despite clarity bookingcom handle situation day mark poor communication lack satisfactory responsethis ordeal lead strongly discourage use bookingcom gotogate flight booking inefficiency frustrating customer service issue relate ticket stark contrast competence hotel booking suggest significant area improvement flight booking service

Booked and paid for business class flights for 7 people for Christmas and a few days before we are due to fly they change the booking to all economy tickets. We contacted customer services and they are very unhelpful ans insist we had only booked economy tickets! Luckily we took screenshots of the booking which prove we bought business class and our seat numbers and luggage allowance on the confirmation show business seats and luggage allowance. Nonetheless they are insisting we booked economy. It's essentially fraud as they are selling and making us pay for business and changing it at the last minute and pretending we bought the cheaper fare (and gotogate pocket the difference!). Very unfair to do this to a group of 7 as now we have lost out business seats and left feeling cheated and out of pocket. Wish we had booked with the airline directly.  The customer service were so rude and cut the conversation by sending a message saying we have not written for 3 minutes so the conversation would end - the message was sent seconds after the previous message and while we had been messaging back and forward without delay (again we have screenshots to prove this). So cheeky to lie like that.

"Booked flights via booking.com. The airline changed one of the flights, sending us to another airport which meant we would miss our connection.The first communication from GTG didn't include what the change was and neither included an option. Every time I replied they would take 2 days to get back to me. This went on for around 2 weeks, with no resolution. At some point I found an alternative flight and asked them to book us on that flight, they still couldn't reply to me to confirm. Then around 10 days before the departure date (at this point we had been communicating for around 10 days), after I had called them several times, I received an email with confirmation however such change had not been made from the airline side (I checked directly with the airline), this went on for another 4-5 days until I got fed up and asked for a full refund then purchased the exact same tickets with MyTrip, which in fact cost less than the original price charged by GTG.I did get a refund in the end, minus around £25 without any explanation but to be honest, at that point I couldn't be bothered to deal with them anymore.I will never ever book another flight with GTG.",2,Negative,book flight via bookingcom airline change one flight send we another airport mean would miss connectionthe first communication gtg do not include change neither include option every time reply would take day get back go around week resolution point find alternative flight ask book we flight still could not reply confirm around day departure date point communicate around day call several time receive email confirmation however change make airline side check directly airline go another day get feed ask full refund purchase exact ticket mytrip fact cost less original price charge gtgi get refund end minus around without explanation honest point could not bother deal anymorei never ever book another flight gtg

According to GoToGate email, that refund should arrive within five business days.However, I am still waiting for the refund for one and a half months.

"I've been a fan of booking.com for several years, for booking hotels mostly. This year, booking.com partnered up with gotogate.com to start providing flights. This was exciting for me, as it meant I'd have both flights and accommodation all under one umbrella.I had booked another family flight via gotogate for the summer and while it wasn't a great experience dealing with them, it wasn't too bad either.Hsving said that, I believe partnering with gotogate has been an abysmal disaster for booking.com and as of today, I've cancelled all bookings (hotels and flights!) I have with booking.com as a result, based on three issues:1) when I pay a premium to ensure flexibility of my tickets (especially when bought 6-9 months ahead), it's so I don't have to have a headache down the line. This is on top of the actual airfare and it goes to the agent, not the airline (I still need to cough up fare difference if any!)2) when I ask to change dates (based on said flexibility), I do not expect to get a quote for a fare difference that is 110% of the original fare paid and all legs get bumped down to Economy from Business class?!?!?. Now I know it can happen, but imagine my surprise when I go direct to the airline (within an hour of the revised quote) and was able purchase the same tickets for less than 50% of the fare difference I got quoted by gotogate? That was the first break in the trust I'd always had in them.3) so I go ahead and cancel the tickets, processed the refund (minus the extra bit paid to gotogate for flexibility). As you can imagine, it's a fair whack and I've had to buy new tickets for the same journey. Got an email confirming refund will be done within 14 days. All good.......Two and a half weeks later, I'm chasing up as to why my refund hasn't been credited? I have to go through chat each time - same old same old' ""it's being processed""; at this point, I'm patient (these things happen) and get follow up emails that you can't reply back to (unmonitored mailbox from individual-signed emails, that you keep replying to but get no responses or even a bounce back response that it's unmonitored).Almost daily follow ups and its a different person each time, with the same pat responses.1 week after the SLA for when my refund should be in my account, every person I chat to tells me the same ""it's been escalated and prioritised as urgent"", but no follow up and no response and no feedback on whats actually happening.You might get someone random emailing you that they tried to call you (even though no such call was made), but also from an unmonitored mailbox that you cannot reply to or debate whether such a call was ever made!)Here's the funny thing, I've dealt with the airline in question for almost 10 years and even in the most contentious or difficult situations (very rare), they usually refund within 7-10 days in my personal experience.Get on a chat with gotogate/ booking.com and they close the chat on you if you insist on getting concrete answers vs. pat responses; when you call and insist on escalating to a manager since this has been pending for more than 3 weeks with no movement, they conveniently hang up on you.At this point, I've simply cancelled all bookings with booking.com and want nothing to do with gotogate, seeing as this is the level of service they've now devolved into.It is especially galling to see this level of abysmal customer service from gotogate, with no ramifications or accountability at any level of the organisation, and what feels like being abetted by booking.com to boot.25Dec23 - follow up: I thought it beneficial to add a follow up since my initial post. I took the liberty of going directly to the airline last week, to get to the bottom of gotogate's assertions that the refund was pending with the airline....according to the airline, that's untrue and gotogate could have refunded my money to me at any point in time. When I relayed this to both booking.com and gotogate, the latter hasn't had any response for me. Booking.com started following up with me, but then tansferred the issue to gotogate and have since washed their hands off this.

"I booked a flight in Brazil. The flight got rerouted 2 weeks before departure and I never accepted the changes so I contacted customer service by then to cancel the flight and refund: simple task. It took me 3 times across 2 weeks and uncountable waiting hours during my holidays, passing the case from one department to another, getting useless answers by email avoiding the cancellation and refund confirmation, asking me to contact them back to discuss. Finally the confirmation from them to cancel and submit a refund, was 'completed' the same day of departure!! after another painful waiting time. Unfortunately, a few weeks later, again another useless email asking to contact them, so after a couple of hours and several teams involved, someone confirmed me that the cancelation rules of the flying company had fees over the price of the refund, leaving me with no solution and no money, and just a suggestion of contacting the flying company myself. The feeling left is they did not wanted to cancel the flight and get the refund on time.  They don't care about refunding money at all. Such a pain contacting them every time. On the top of this, after confirming by the customer service agent to send me all the transcriptions of my conversations during the process, this was never delivered except the last conversation with the conclusions. I had used them in the past, and if everything goes as planned is ok, but if something happens is just not worth it and you are on your own and became a waste of time.

"Do not use GotoGate. I cancelled my return flight due to a change in work schedule. The airline confirmed they would provide a full refund to the cancellation. However, 4 months later, Gotogate still has not returned my money. I have called them over 15 times over the past 4 months trying to get my refund, but they say I ""need to wait a little longer"". They constantly lie to get you off of the phone, saying a manager or their refund department will call back with more details. They told me this every time I called and I never received a call back.Gotogate claimed the airline had not refunded them and was not responded to their request, therefore they could not refund me. However, I reached out to the airline directly (airline responded within a 12 hrs), and the airlines provided proof that they refunded Gotogate on Oct. 4 (December at the time of writing and Gotogate still claims the airline has not refunded them). This seems to be a common experience for others as well.4 days ago I contacted my bank to charge back my funds and I have received my money back. Gotogate still withheld their service fee for processing a refund so it is clear they were holding my refund and once my bank got involved, they processed it.If anyone else is having a bad experience with getting a refund from Gotogate, contact the airline directly to see how much of a refund you are owed and if Gotogate does not refund you in a reasonable amount of time, go directly to your bank.To any potential customers, do not use this service.

Honestly the worst customer service! This Go To Gate is the classic case take your money and run company. Had an issue at the airport with one of their bookings that left me stranded in South Africa for 2 days back in August. When trying to contact them they had no regard or empathy and did not care. They are a subed out company that works through a call centre in India and sounds like they have not been trained to handle anything more then either placing you on hold or hanging up on you. They are not ATOL registered and refuse to acknowledge who they are regulated by as not covered in the UK. I have been chasing them for a response for nearly 5 mouths now as had to purchase a new ticket out of pocket which is not covered under travel insurance.

Gotogate initially displayed a price of $2292/ for 4 tickets and after putting in all the passenger information and submitting to buy it changed the final price to $2337/- . I was little upset with this bait and switch technique. However since the difference was not that high I bought the tickets. (assuming the ticket price went up while I was filling in the passenger info. But after 30 mins or so after buying the ticket at a higher price I again did the same route search and the ticket price for 4 tickets again showed $2292/- so  it looks like Gotogate is back on applying the trick of bait and switch.  I have taken the screen prints and time stamp and will put on variolous forum.,1,Negative,gotogate initially display price ticket put passenger information submit buy change final price little upset bait switch technique however since difference high buy ticket assume ticket price go fill passenger info min buy ticket high price route search ticket price ticket show look like gotogate back apply trick bait switch take screen print time stamp put variolous forum

"We regret to say that if we could assign zero stars, we would. This company is not even worth one star; it's rife with dishonesty. We strongly advise potential customers to carefully consider our experience before opting for their services.We purchased tickets through them, only to face unexpected flight time changes and a disrupted connecting flight schedule. In response, we promptly submitted a refund request. And we have also received a confirmation of our flight cancellation and confirmation of their process to request for refund. However, it has been six months, and their responses have been consistently misleading. They claim to be waiting for the airline's input and direct us to check with the local airline head office in China.Fortunately, we have a friend in China who went to the head office on our behalf. Shockingly, there is no record of our refund request in their system. This level of service is not only the worst we’ve encountered, but their customer service is also filled with deception.We implore anyone considering their service to exercise caution and be aware of the potential pitfalls. It's a regrettable situation, and we hope our experience serves as a warning to others.13/12/2023 Respond to the reply : I am disappointed to be accused of causing delays in my refund process due to sending multiple inquiry emails. Is it fair to consider my follow-up emails as the reason for the prolonged handling and response time?I submitted my initial flight cancellation request and refund request on 25/5/2023, immediately addressing a flight time change.It's been seven months since May 2024, with numerous follow-up emails yielding no updates or responses on the progress of my refund. Your silence on my case raises concerns about your handling of the situation.There hasn't been an apology for the oversight in processing my refund request. Despite firm replies claiming it was in progress, a revelation on 30/11/2024 from China Southern Airline's headquarters indicated that no refund claim was filed.Upon checking with China Southern Airline's headquarters in Mainland China, they confirmed not receiving any of my ticket refund claims.

"The Booking.com has been our number one for booking service for many years. I have booked accommodation multiple times using their site and have never had an issue until this year.But in April 2023 we purchased a cruise starting from London, UK in June 2023. Therefore, we also booked 2 days accommodation in London via Booking.com to ensure that we will not be late for our cruise.So, I thought I could trust them also for flight booking too. It was late evening and I didn't check any reviews about their flight service. This was my great and also regrettable mistake.I used Booking.com website to purchase Malaysian Airlines flights for me and my wife from Australia to London and also return flights in the late August back to Australia.The booking process was quite simple; select flights, ensure correct luggage allowance, select seats, and finally get all details with charges on the ""check and pay"" screen before paying. As per a good practice I saved the ""check and pay"" screen page for my reference.After paying by a credit card we soon get an emails from Booking.com confirming the flight with the airline booking reference number. It seems that all needed was well done.However, this is the first time we have encountered problems at the airport at check-in time because the Malaysian Airline personnel refused to process our two suitcases. I was showing them our ""check and pay"" ticket information with two 20 kg checked bags included....They checked our tickets on their airline system and informed us that they have a different version of tickets on their system, which includes only the ""Light economy luggage allowance"" without the checked bags although our ""check and pay"" screenshot showed two 20 kg checked bags allowance.My wife and I were surprised,  shocked and also devastated at this time.The airline personnel indicated that I am not the first customer with such a problem.Trying to help us, they advise us to repack our suitcases and pay over 1500 AUD for the excess luggage in order to continue our flight to London.The Booking.com and GoToGate didn't deliver us the flight tickets as per details of our ""check and pay"" order.Our claim for compensation was diverted to GoToGate.com but after 3 months waiting the GoToGate refused to compensate us for the incurred cost of over 1500 AUD paid for the excess luggage although obvious deficiency in their service system (probably software problem and/or their service being  located in India, many other customers experience similar events as per many reviews for Booking.com and GoToGate).Be aware that the Booking.com includes many other partners and therefore their service quality is deteriorating. And do not trust some reviews made by commercial hired website agents/contractors providing services for TAs as these could be misleading. Even Trust pilot.com rating for these two TAs mentioned above might be too optimistic.🤔Hence, based on my experience and also other customers included in the productreview.com.au or au.trustpilot.com I will not recommend their flight services even to my enemies.And finally, maybe there is a new role for the Trustpilot.com to inform ACCC on such frequent events involving such TA with substandard quality service?",1,Negative,bookingcom number one booking service many year book accommodation multiple time use site never issue yearbut april purchase cruise start london uk june therefore also book day accommodation london via bookingcom ensure late cruiseso thought could trust also flight booking late evening do not check review flight service great also regrettable mistakei use bookingcom website purchase malaysian airline flight wife australia london also return flight late august back australiathe booking process quite simple select flight ensure correct luggage allowance select seat finally get detail charge check pay screen pay per good practice save check pay screen page referenceafter pay credit card soon get email bookingcom confirm flight airline booking reference number seem need well donehowever first time encounter problem airport checkin time malaysian airline personnel refuse process two suitcase show check pay ticket information two kg check bag includedthey check ticket airline system inform we different version ticket system include light economy luggage allowance without check bag although check pay screenshot show two kg check bag allowancemy wife surprise shock also devastate timethe airline personnel indicate first customer problemtrying help we advise we repack suitcase pay aud excess luggage order continue flight londonthe bookingcom gotogate do not deliver we flight ticket per detail check pay orderour claim compensation divert gotogatecom month wait gotogate refuse compensate we incur cost aud pay excess luggage although obvious deficiency service system probably software problem andor service locate india many customer experience similar event per many review bookingcom gotogatebe aware bookingcom include many partner therefore service quality deteriorate trust review make commercial hire website agentscontractor provide service ta could mislead even trust pilotcom rate two ta mention might optimistichence base experience also customer include productreviewcomau autrustpilotcom recommend flight service even enemiesand finally maybe new role trustpilotcom inform accc frequent event involve ta substandard quality service

NEVER BOOK WITH Gotogate. I have had a long running battle with them about flights that were cancelled. They told me it was the airlines fault. After 2 years they refunded me the airline taxes. TODAY I have had a response from the Passenger Advice and Complaints Team (PACT) of the Civil Aviation Authority saying that the airline has confirmed that a refund was sent to GotoGate in January 2023. This means not only has GoToGage not advised me for over 9 months that it had received a refund and directly lied to me saying they had not but have only paid me a third of the refund due. They still owe me the balance of nearly £900 which they have clearly withheld from me.

"Avoid like the plague.I booked a family flight from Manchester to Thailand in January, In the summer and unfortunately for one of the passengers, a spelling correction on Apple device has meant that the first name was incorrect. I have raised several requests to have this corrected, Saudi Airways do have a policy where 3 letters can be corrected, however it can only be requested by the agency who booked the flight, in this case GotoGate.Having raised so many requests I was promised that it would be requested to the airline and resolved in good time ahead of my flight not to worry. I have been following that up this week, receiving replies that there is no specific update, but that it is in hand. I then received an email today basically saying, sorry it is not possible, speak to the airline, if you want to rebook let us know. To say I have been stonewalled is an understatement. I have asked for escalation, to be able to speak with the booking team directly etc. No, only allowed to speak to the customer representative, who knows absolutely nothing, cannot even provide a request reference that GotoGate used when requesting the name change with the airlines, nothing. Just a sorry, we cannot help you attitude! How is it possible that something a simple as correcting 2 x letters of a first name of a ticket, first requested months ago, can be such an impossibility.I will never ever book via GotoGate (or probably any agency) in future and will always book with an airline direct. Beyond useless. And now I have to hope and prey that within 24 hours of flying the airline will be able to update the name. If not I will lose £££ thousands in hotel fees, have 4 x absolutely distraught children and a wife, who are looking forward to seeing relatives for the first time pre-covid.Beyond useless is how I would describe GotoGate. As much use as a chocolate fireguard.

"Are they thieves???1 star is still too high for them. Since Feb 23 - I have been trying to get my refund. They said they followed the rules of the airline for refunds but they lied. I raised a dispute with my bank but GTG lied again to say I did not contact them, nor did I ask for a refund when I showed them my call log and the proof that Turkish Airlines issued a full refund due to the bad weather and the earthquake. Eventually said they would give me a refund but they gave me 37 pounds when I paid 452 pounds. You might be saving a few pounds but trust me, it is not worth it and they should not even be allowed to trade at how bad they treat customers.

The worst travel booking company in the world!!! Avoid at all costs even if they appear cheaper it’s not worth it at all! Always book direct with airline! I booked flights last night and shortly after I got an email saying the payment didn’t go through despite my money coming out my account. I went through the link in the email and they wanted me to reconfirm at a much higher price. It’s a total scam!!! Words can’t describe how bad this company is. I then called their customer service and they couldn’t care less. They said it would take 5 days for my refund. Which means my payment was successful in the first place. The email telling me the payment didn’t go through was just a scam from them so I could pay more when reconfirming.,1,Negative,bad travel book company world avoid cost even appear cheap worth always book direct airline book flight last night shortly get email say payment do not go despite money come account go link email wanted reconfirm much high price total scam word can not describe bad company call customer service could not care less say would take day refund mean payment successful first place email tell payment do not go scam could pay reconfirming

Well where do i start?.I have always had good service from booking.com so i thought i would book a flight using them. They use gotogate for flight booking ( a rather optimistic name in my opinion....) .. they are worse than useless.We booked a return flight to the USA which involved a connection at JFK.The flight times changed which meant that we only had 10 mins to change flights at JFK....Gotogate did not notice this until i phoned them up to tell them which i find most surprising.How can they sell a flight which leaves the customer 10 mins to catch a connecting flight at one of the busiest Airports in the world?I spent the next 3 weeks phoning them up to see if they had changed the flight but every time they told me the matter had been 'escalated' but guess what ...nothing actually happened.I had to email one of the VP's at booking.com to get this issue looked at.By the time they pulled their finger out  all the flights had been sold so they could only offer us a flight the next day which meant another night's accomodation to pay for.At this point they offered us a refund and they cancelled our booking (but we still had messages from them asking us to check in for the cancelled flights....)We ended up booking alternative flights at a higher cost.My advice is don't book a flight with these clowns - book direct with an airline instead.Edit - they have replied and said they would like further custom off me.They must be joking.,1,Negative,well starti always good service bookingcom think would book flight use use gotogate flight booking rather optimistic name opinion bad uselesswe book return flight usa involve connection jfkthe flight time change mean min change flight jfkgotogate notice phoned tell find surprisinghow sell flight leave customer min catch connect flight one busy airport worldi spend next week phone see change flight every time tell matter escalate guess nothing actually happenedi email one vps bookingcom get issue look atby time pull finger flight sell could offer we flight next day mean another night accomodation pay forat point offer we refund cancel booking still message ask we check cancel flightswe end book alternative flight high costmy advice do not book flight clowns book direct airline insteadedit reply say would like custom methey must joke

"Initially, I did not even know that I was booking through GoToGate, because I was doing my booking through Momondo. Anyway, the booking went fine, cheap, quick, and confirmed in minutes. However, the ticket was one thing but the seats were something else what was charged around $30 each per person per flight. But OK even that is not so bad. All of the hassle started when the airlines shifted my return flight one day before original date. This was not acceptable and I decided to rebook. Initially, it seemed just fine, paid the requested amount for the rebooking and chose the flight offered during the conversation. One day passed but my information on the official airline app did not change. Figured it would take more time so gave them another day to resolve it. Tomorrow still nothing. Started the chat and I was reassured that all is good, they escalated my case to make sure all is taken care in time. Two days later still nothing. This time I was fortunate enough to be in the states and I found their phone number and started riding it twice a day minimum to make them do the rebooking. The answer they gave me every time was that the airliner would not send them confirmation of the rebooking and they are escalating my case. This took 6 days and they all read their scripted material without hickup. Kept escalating my case, if it was a stick it would reach the moon. The last day, hours before the flight I called and demanded my rebooking to be finalized, which eventually made them to lift the authorization to be transferred to the airliner. At this point the airliner resolved my problem in matter of minutes and rebooked me for the requested flight. So my conclusion is that GoToGate is most certainly in debt with the airline company and could not do anything or just did not care about my problems, either way not good. I consider myself very lucky not to lose my flight. Heard many people had worse experiences with them.Absolutely do not recommend as travel agency. I ended up having to deal with them because I did not check before how they did their business. It is not worth to lose sleep over few tens of dollars more with good and verified agency.

"We took the 'flexible' ticket option on our internal flights in Vietnam. Having the option to make a single change of date seemed to be worth the additional cost. Our plans did change, and we requested a change - same flight, just two days later; and before the specified time limit. We were subjected to the same prevaricating tactics described in an earlier post - they spent a couple of hours checking flights, rules etc. Finally took a rebooking fee from our credit card, which we assumed meant that we had been rebooked. We then received an email informing us that there had been 'technical difficulties' in making the rebooking, and offering us the 'option' of receiving a refund of the flight part of our original booking, together with the rebooking fee. The only other option, which would be implemented if we didn't respond to their email within 10 hours, was for them to close the case! We were left with having to make our own reservations.

"We (2 adults and a child) had booked flexible return ticket from BLR to LHR. Full adult fair was paid even for child while booking originally. We travelled BLR on to LHR on 2nd Jan 2022. It was Vistara for domestic and Virgin Atlantic for international sector.Due to covid, the ticket was made open ticket for the return segment (LHR to BLR) to be used by 31st Dec 2023. I have been contacting their office for last 4 weeks and must have discussed with several of their call centre agents. Nobody was able to complete the re-booking. Every time they gave some excuse for not resolving the issue. The issues they reported were:a) Child is over 16 years now when booking was made the child was 15 years old. For that I told them full adult fair was paid while booking itself hence it was not an excuseb) No flights available for the dates i requested. Then i challenged them as the seats were available in airline website as well as other travel agent websites for the dates i requested, then they use to say they would discuss with airline and get back. They never used to get back hence then when i called them next, told them, book any day in November for 2 passengers and for 1 in December then they said they need to price the ticket. I told them it was flexible ticket that they should charge me extra (I had paid extra Rs 42,272 while booking as mentioned in their invoice which is apart from airline ticket charge). On 4th Nov an agent called Ayesha came out with the most laughable solution, that is to rebook, she asked we had to pay Rs 340,000 per passenger extra for November journey and additional Rs 240,000 for December journey per person. When I pointed to her that the current price on the same airline website or other travel agents shows almost 1/10th of what Ayesha quoted, she asked me she can't help which is their company policy and airline is charging them, she asked me to speak to airline directly. I told her that it was basically by over quoating, the travel agent or airline or combination of both denying my right to have return journey when i have purchased flexible open return ticket (By paying premium price while booking).I asked Ayesha to arrange immediate refund for the price paid for flexible ticket which was travel agent's product but not airline's, and also ask airline to refund for the return journey ticket price as it was booked through the Gotogate. She kept on saying it was not possible to refund. I told her there are no terms and conditions which say they can't refund when they can't provide retun ticket having taken the money from my card. Finally she said she would escalate to concerned department and hung up the phone (perhaps disconnected itself but she didn't have the curtesy to call back to mention the call got disconnected.

"We booked a journey with several layovers to Australia. Over the space of a few months our flights were changed several times - this is fine because there are so many flights it makes sense some are cancelled. However, after the 4th or 5th reschedule, one of our layovers was reduced from a few hours to 50 minutes. This made us nervous as any slight delay in our previous flight and we miss the rest of our international flights and we're stuck in the wrong country. We called several times and I was transferred 19 times over the space of 3 hours. Each time I had to re-explain the issue to the new person, who would then say they were transferring me to the ""correct"" department, and the loop continues. I called the airline to see if we could be put on an earlier flight, and they said there are flights every hour between these two destinations and we could be put on an earlier one, but since our flights were managed by GoToGate, and they refused to do anything at all, we could not change our flights.Well, our concerns were correct, because the flight was delayed by 1 hour. Fortunately they held the flight back for us, but we had to run to the gate. As a result, our luggage was lost and we ended in Sydney with no luggage for several days until they arrived.Honestly just avoid booking through this company, it's worth the extra money to go through the airline and not deal with the stress of calling the most useless support line ever.",1,Negative,book journey several layover australia space month flight change several time fine many flight make sense cancel however th th reschedule one layover reduce hour minute make we nervous slight delay previous flight miss rest international flight stick wrong country call several time transfer time space hour time reexplain issue new person would say transfer correct department loop continues call airline see could put early flight say flight every hour two destination could put early one since flight manage gotogate refuse anything could change flightswell concern correct flight delay hour fortunately hold flight back we run gate result luggage lose end sydney luggage several day arrivedhonestly avoid book company worth extra money go airline deal stress call useless support line ever

Absolutely dreadful company. Make mistakes and don’t rectify them. No customer service at all. Speak to people from India who are obviously working from a script.

Just keep getting told to “wait a time” (already waited 7 months) or “it’s been escalated” When you ask for a supervisor you get told someone will ring you within 24 hours. We’re still waiting after requesting numerous times. Do yourself a favour and don’t book flights with BOOKING.COM as they use this useless company GOTOGATE. Always go to the airline direct.

"I am deeply disappointed with the customer service provided by this ticketing agency. I purchased my tickets in full three years ago, and the airline canceled the flight. During this extended period, the lack of reasonable updates and communication has been astonishing. I have relied solely on their website for information.Despite making multiple calls to the agency, I received nothing but empty promises. They assured me that my issue had been escalated on numerous occasions, but no one from their end ever bothered to contact me.Now, after three years of waiting, the resolution they offer is to deny my refund because the airline supposedly did not pay them the required amount. This means I am left with nothing, despite having paid for the tickets in good faith. I find this extremely unfair as a customer.Moreover, it is clear that the agency has shown no intention of taking responsibility for resolving the matter with the airline, which is, after all, their role as a third party ticket seller. To make matters worse, my recent call to their agent was met with rudeness as they told me to contact the airline directly.This level of service is completely unacceptable. I strongly urge others to exercise caution when dealing with this agency, as they have demonstrated a lack of commitment to their customers' interests and well-being.",1,Negative,deeply disappointed customer service provide ticket agency purchase ticket full three year ago airline cancel flight extend period lack reasonable update communication astonishing rely solely website informationdespite making multiple call agency receive nothing empty promise assure issue escalate numerous occasion one end ever bother contact menow three year waiting resolution offer deny refund airline supposedly pay require amount mean leave nothing despite pay ticket good faith find extremely unfair customermoreover clear agency show intention take responsibility resolve matter airline role third party ticket seller make matter bad recent call agent meet rudeness tell contact airline directlythis level service completely unacceptable strongly urge other exercise caution deal agency demonstrate lack commitment customer interest wellbee

If I could give them NO stars I would. We made a booking in May 23 but late Aug the airline canx one of our connecting flights and the alternative offered meant an 8hr layover which I didn’t want. There was an alternative flight which would’ve worked better and even after numerous calls to their customer service they didn’t change the flight. Everytime I got told ‘waiting for airline authorisation’ I contacted the airline too and they clearly advised me that my flight could be changed and all the agent ‘Go to Gate’ had to do was call and request the change and it would be done. I explained this to GTG and even gave them the telephone number but still nothing. Qatar Airways took control of my booking 96hrs before travel and 1 call to them and they made the change - no questions asked!! 2 months of calling GTG and I got nowhere.

They keep coming up with different information every time I call, firstly I was told I could change either the departure or the coming back or both at the same time, now they are telling me I cannot change only one of them, it has to be both. When I was finally given some sort of decent price to change my ticket, I was having connection issues so I asked if this information could be saved for me for 15 minutes which was what I needed to get home and make the payment. I was assured that this was not a problem and everything was saved for the next representative to send me directly to payment. Not even 15 minutes passed when I called back and I was told the price was double what I was told 5 minutes ago.

"I booked 2 business class tickets from Stockholm to Koh Samui with them. We had to change our flights but for 2 weeks we have been getting same useless replies from their customer “support” that we have to wait or talk to another department. It seems to us that there is just excuses, and we have never received any phone call back as promised. We had an email from them however saying they could change our flights if we confirmed on live chat to them, but when we tried to do that then they revert back to that we need to wait again and again. They seem to just have a strategy of frustrating you until you give up. You have to explain the problem to a new person every time, then after a long wait will come back with same obtuse answer that you already heard before. There is no way that this is a legit company. I would never use this company again. Complete scam when it comes to customer support.",1,Negative,book business class ticket stockholm koh samui change flight week get useless reply customer support wait talk another department seem we excuse never receive phone call back promise email however say could change flight confirm live chat try revert back need wait seem strategy frustrating give explain problem new person every time long wait come back obtuse answer already hear way legit company would never use company complete scam come customer support

I highly recommend going elsewhere. They cancelled my flight and put me on a flight which had a 12 over layover instead of a few hours. I then asked if there was anything they could do to get me on an early flight so I didn't need to wait that long. They then said I'd have to pay for a whole new fair along with a fee. The customer service is awful. I was passed around and when I didn't reply straight away they ended the chat. Total waste of my morning. I am nervous flyer so the idea of spending 12 hours on a layover is really not great. I would have appreciated more help on this. So disappointed.,1,Negative,highly recommend go elsewhere cancel flight put flight layover instead hour ask anything could get early flight do not need wait long say i d pay whole new fair along fee customer service awful pass around do not reply straight away end chat total waste morning nervous flyer idea spend hour layover really great would appreciate help disappoint

"this is a continuation of the previous review...After this I contacted another GTG office (Of course the local number provided in this chat above does not even exist): After a long long phone call and being in tears trying to find out what was actually happening with our money, she finally said something that made my heart stop: “ Somebody in the office who handles the refunds has made an error  - a mistake and did not lodge the refund request correctly. Due to that, the Sri Lankan Airlines have rejected it. Then after my initial shock and river of questions, she even mentioned that due to the error, the application had NOT BEEN LODGED AT ALL! These were the 2 versions she provided me, perhaps unaware that both are very different. Her voice was shaking and I asked her with all honesty to tell me the truth, she did not say any more, just kept mumbling the same…We apologize, we will lodge it now and escalate it. “We will not keep your money” When I asked her to provide me with what she said regarding the error in writing (same as the transcript of the chat conversation you see above), she refused as it was against company policies. (Of course, what they say can not be traced, the customer has no proof and they keep the records for internal purposes only).I spent my precious time (who is a mum knows how valuable time is) sitting at the computer and writing and messaging and reloading my Skype credit to call for help. I feel that humanity has once again proved to us that companies scattered around the world are working tirelessly to redistribute money in a way, that involves taking them from others. Then they wait until the system wears them down as it is a time & energy costly process that we have been going through. They count on you giving up and them keeping your money !!!!!!

"This is absolutely a scam company . Customer do fall into their trap by looking at the cheap tickets . This is exactly what happened to my case . My order number is MLUL49.i bought a ticket from gotogate for Dhaka to  Paris on Wednesday the 1st of November 23  .i went to airport as usual but surprisingly airline staff at the boarding pass desk told me they only able to find one part of my journey on their system not final part of the journey to Paris . They even showed me on their desk computer screen .I immediately contacted Gotogate and spent 1.5 hours ,speaking to 3 different staffs but they were absolutely clueless and confused .They were unable to give any answers why my ticket wasn’t available on the airline system according to the bookings or the confirmation email they sent to me ? Again no response .They asked me to contact airline about this , I said I bought ticket from you so it’s your responsibility to contact the airline and get me the ticket I bought so that I can fly today but no reply  .I felt that I am a victim of fraud and scam and they did that to me on purpose .After waiting 3 hours at the airport,i returned to home . I never faced such traumatic experiences in 19 years of my travelling life .Finally I asked for a refund but mentioned to me that they would charge me around £300 fee , I asked what is my fault here and why can’t I have the full refund? Again no answer .Then I basically told him I will call my bank to report the transaction to be stopped and he hang up on me .i was upset yes but i will do everything in my power to recover my hardworking money .

"Horrible experience costing me thousands! Booked a flight through Booking.com (which I'll never do again now thanks to this experience), turns out it was actually GoToGate that did the booking. Everything seemed fine until I was notified by the airline that a flight had changed to 24 hours later. This was an unacceptable change so contacted support. They advised there was an alternative route that occurred on the same dates as the original booking but had to put in a ""request"" to rebook it. After a week, contacted again to check the status. New person had no idea what I was talking about and would make the ""request"" again. Followed up a few days later and was told the request was rejected. So I opted to have the flights cancelled. As this was a change of over 3 hours, I am entitled to a full refund if I decline the change. They told me they can't refund me until the airline refunds them and that they don't know how much it will be. This sounds like their problem not mine and should have provided me my full refund on the spot. An email received said to track your refund check your booking, but now my booking doesn't even come up when searched. I engaged my bank to perform a chargeback from these scammers. I have also had to pay thousands more to rebook the same flights elsewhere. I regret ever making a booking with them.

"Terrible experience. I needed to cancel a flight (cancellable pre departure fare, cancelling because of disorders in Middle East on consulate recommendation). I contact the chat assistance, they keep me waiting for more than 1 hour, and after getting in touch with the online service, they don't find a solution and ask me to contact the airline. Once I speak with the airline, they bounce me back to GoToGate. I try the phone number, and they hold me on the line, they claim the system is off, then it's back on, then they are not clear on the fare rules, and then when we agree to cancel the flight they don't tell me when I'll receive my refund. Not even approximately. Never again. Terrible service, for no saving whatsoever.Ps: I am editing this review adding this piece as I cannot reply to the GoToGate reply below. That reply just shows everybody how poor the customer focus of this company is. Instead of saying something like ""we apologise for the inconvenience please write us an email at xxx providing yyy and we will sort it out"", they question the truthfulness of what I am saying and ask for a code I wasn't asked to share in here and didn't even submit in here (as i wasnt asked).

We were at Singapore airport when we received an email from Gotogate saying the new flights were also cancelled, & they were not prepared to do anything else to help, all they said is you can apply for a refund.

"Booked flights 6 months in advance, 8h layover, long but still ok. Outbound flight ok, but then before return they change the flight now it's 20h+ layover, something nobody in their right mind would have booked in the first place, or not at the same price! How is it even legal that they can change like that?Called support for hours, they refuse to change for a different flight saying there's nothing else (only same flight on different days, when other airlines are flying), I ask for refund, they refuse to tell me in advance how much is the refund, it ends up being only 25%, well below an expected ~50%. Now I have to buy another set of tickets, one-way, at the last minute so even more expensive, and didn't even get refunded entirely for the flight I didn't fly. I can't believe airlines and these ticket companies have such customer-hostile practices.

"If I could give no stars I would. Flight got cancelled in Croatia by Wizz air, booked through go to gate. Wizz air were quick to issue the refund but could only do to the account that the booking was made under which was made and only had access by go to gate/booking.com. Wizz air confirmed with me in July the money for the refund has been sent to go to gate and that I needed to sort it with them. Now end of October still no refund, I’ve called once a week since July, only to be read the same script about how they’re processing the refund, how they don’t have the money from Wizz air, how they’re really sorry for the inconvenience, how the case is a priority and how I just need to wait it out! Thankfully last time I spoke to them I ask for a full record check, proved I had the email from Wizz air saying go to gate had the refund and then weirdly enough they were able to see that on their accounts (there was officially stunned silence at the other end of the phone). I got this in email proof from go to gate too that they had the refunded money and would be sorting it to be sent to me.  I then got a few emails asking for bank details but What a surprise no refund. Called again only to be told the same scripted spiel, they had no money sent from Wizz air blah blah blah but as soon as I told them about the email they sent the last time proving they had told me they had the refund (after 20 mins of letting them lie) they decided oh no it will be with you in a few days (again this is now in email) I highly doubt that money will be with me in a few days.

"I purchased a ticket to Buenos Aires through them that came up through kayak.com. Their website indicated that everything would be refundable within 24 hours. After booking, I checked out the website of the airline that they had booked me on. I was able to get their most premium option plus an extra bag for less than gotogate had charged (they charged me $75 for one bag, whereas it was included in my price on the airline's site and and extra bag on top of that was only $50). Thinking I had 24 hours for a full refund, I booked and then went ahead and looked back at the website. They were going to refund me minus extra ""third party"" services I had selected ($40). Initially, I was just curious if I could still access these services, given that I am going to be traveling on the exact same flight, so I sparked up a chat. The person (""Mai H"") did not respond to my questions at all. She said that the ""non-refundable services were non-refundable."" I f***ing get it, but if they're non-refundable, then why can't I still use them? They also shouldn't offer these things while saying everything is refundable within 24hours. Lies. 2nd of all, Mai said that they would also be taking $100 off because that's what the airline charges for cancellations. If that's the case, then they also should absolutely not be advertising 24hr cancellation. Pissed, I called the their listed phone number. The person on the phone at least was able to respond to my question about the services (they're associated with the booking, which honestly is bullsh*t in this scenario, but w/e at least he HAD a clear response), but was still telling me that the amount they would be able to refund was less than what their website was listing.

"EDIt - in response to the company response. Excuses and misunderstanding the problem!!! We did not have a problem with the change. We accepted it. The problem is that our son was NOT booked on the new itinerary!!! And he was no longer booked on the original either! Therefore we paid for a leg of the journey and he had NO booking!!! This would seem to be your fault and not the airline!!! NEVER USE THIS COMPANY or BOOKING (dot com) to book a flight. This happened in August and STILL NOT RESOLVED! We are down £800. We booked a return flight from Edinburgh to Lilongwe passing through Doha and Addis Ababa in June 2023. Two weeks before the flight we received an email saying the flight from Addis to Lilongwe was no longer available and a new booking had been made via Blantyre in Malawi to Lilongwe. When my 20 year old son arrived at Addis Ababa to catch the flight to Blantyre he was told he had no booking. They eventually found his name on a list on the flight directly to Lilongwe but apparently it was not confirmed or paid for. THIS WAS PAID IN FULL ON BOOKING. After fruitless attempts to resolve it with Customer Services on the phone while he was standing at the desk, he had no option but to buy a new return ticket from Addis Ababa to Lilongwe. This cost nearly £800. My son is a student. He was on his way to volunteer in a hospital in Malawi!! The original flight that we were told was not available in fact was available and he was on it. PAID FOR TWICE!!! We spent HOURS of time on the phone to this company only to be told that they were contacting the airline about a refund and there was no option but to wait. Meanwhile there were issues with the return flight because of the fact that he was counted as a NO SHOW for the flight that he was told he was not booked on to. Again it took hours of phone calls (direct to airlines in the end as this company refused to help) and stress to finally make sure he was accepted on to the return flight from Addis Ababa to Edinburgh. Now that he is home we have just received an email saying that the airline (Ethiopian) are denying the refund and if we want to continue pursuing it we have to contact Customer Services again. We have proof all this which we have already sent to them with no acknowledgment.

"Absolutely horrendous. My S.O. and I both got tickets for our trip from Montreal to Oslo. He paid extra for a flexible ticket so he could change the date of his departure. The day he changes it (which was over 24 hours before departure), the customer service agents are utterly useless. It took ages getting hold of one and when we did they were difficult to communicate with and eventually since it took them so long to respond to messages, we were logged out of the server due to inactivity on the page. That's how slow they are. Throughout the day I attempt contacting them again on multiple occasions and yet they never got back to us. I have screenshots that prove that this mistake was on their behalf, yet they will not take this and are refusing to refund us. So essentially since they never offered us any service, they have stolen $625 from us that we will never see again.I will never use this company again in my life and will strongly advice anyone against using them ever.

Surely not a coincidence, these sites have “bots” that adjust the prices when you click pay…basically a scam software.The call center admin whom I spoke to, said the only way I get my refund in full is that had to pay a fee. I agreed to pay this fee of roughly $80…in order to get it over with.

I then went to check in and found out that I am still economy. After spending $4694!!!!!! I have spent over 8 hours in the phone trying to sort this out. Each time I call I am put through to a new agent and have to repeat myself. On a number of occasions they have admitted that this is an error on their end. They claim to have “escalated the situation” and say that the supervisor will call be but I have been waiting for over a week to speak to a supervisor. I don’t use this word lightly, but this is literally theft. GoTOGate charged me over $4000 for an upgraded, took my money and did not upgrade me. I have agents put the phone down on me.

"I AM TELLING EVERYONE WHO WISHES TO USE THIS COMPANY FOR BOOKING TICKETS IS TO AVOID THIS COMPANY AT EVERY COST AND TO NOT DEAL WITH THEM AND PAY THAT LITTLE EXTRA AND DEAL WITH THE AIRLINES DIRECT.IT HAS LEARNED ME A VERY GOOD AND HARD LESSON!!!…I booked my tickets online via booking.com to later find out that this company named Gotogate is behind the bookings.I booked my tickets on the 4th of May 23 as my family were going in the summer holidays.I paid the full amount and in July less than 48 before the flight we get a message saying that the tickets have been cancelled.From the 4th of May 2023 till today being the 16th of October 2023, it’s been 6 months and I am still waiting for the rest of my refund. As in late August early September they partially refunded me half of the ticket.Being passed over from one person to the other is an absolute ridiculous way of being treated inhumanely as possible. These companies have call centres in India and the language barrier being another issue. When u ask them you get told that someone shall call within the next 48hrs or an by an email update. Not a single call or an email to be updated, alternatively I’ve been calling them and the airline to be told that all the responsibility falls upon GotoGate.Ive been calling GotoGate and the airline back and forth for the refund, they unnecessarily made me call the airline direct who helped me as much as they could, but said that because that I had booked through GotoGate and not directly through them,they could not issue me with a refund. But helped me through by keeping me informed that they had processed theRefund and for what ever reason GotoGate isn’t refunding me the money that was entirely GotoGates decision. I called GotoGate on Friday to be told that no one had put any information on the system for the refund to be generated. I also got told that I shall be receiving the refund in 3/4 working days. I’ve just had it enough with this company and would urge any person who wants to fly with this company directly or through booking.com to avoid it like the plague.The aftermath of dealing with this company is no less than living a nightmare. I got told that the outbound ticket got cancelled but the inbounds were good to go, when I told them if they couldn’t fly my family out how could they fly back in?..They not just spoilt my families holiday but the whole experience was a harsh lesson these cowboys taught me. An absolute joke and very unprofessional company,who employs incompetent people who think that in a worst situation if one’s polite and isn’t raising they’re voice to address a situation created by them it’s alright to mess that person about. An absolute SHAMEFUL act by this company ran by Cowboys.I didn’t want to even give them 1star but the system doesn’t allow me to. I shall be sending a copy of this link along with the call logs and names of the customer representatives of this company to IATA,ATOL and any body that looks over repremanding incompetent companies like this who give the rest of the good hard working companies out they’re a bad name too. I shall make sure that this does not happen again to anybody in any sort of degrading and inhumane way in future by exposing this company on all platforms and forums where anything to do with international travel and flying is concerned.…………………………………………………Just received feedback to my review today being the 5th of November 2023, just to add I still have not received my full refund since booking the tickets being the 4th of May and they are so bold and courageous to ask me to give them a chance for my future travels and to give them future business? Do they you think I’m stupid? Fool someone else. Every time I call I get told within 24-48hrs we shall be contacting me,and then another week passes and I call and get told the same story again. I have to keep telling them when I call, that no one has called or emailed me .. it’s been 7 months and I’m still waiting for your jackanory stories to end and for you and your phoney Indian operators to refund me my money back.

"My airline changed my flight twice.  I called GoToGate, who I booked the tickets through, and expressed my concern that I wanted a full refund, specifically because I had paid $1300 for seat upgrades that I was no longer guaranteed to have.  I mentioned this several times, and not once did the agent inform me that GoToGate would not refund this LARGE amount of money.This is AGAINST the refund policy of the US Department of Transportation, which states, ""A consumer is entitled to a refund of fees paid for an optional service (for example, baggage fees, seat upgrades, or in-flight Wi-Fi) if the consumer was unable to use the optional service due to a flight cancellation, delay, schedule change, or a situation where the consumer was involuntarily denied boarding.""",1,Negative,airline change flight twice call gotogate book ticket express concern want full refund specifically pay seat upgrade long guarantee mention several time agent inform gotogate would refund large amount moneythis refund policy we department transportation states consumer entitle refund fee pay optional service example baggage fee seat upgrade inflight wifi consumer unable use optional service due flight cancellation delay schedule change situation consumer involuntarily deny boarding

"I wish I wasn't having to write this review, but here we are.I booked an around-the-world trip with GoToGate.com, to arrange flights from UK-AUS-CAN-UK. I booked early, and there were a few re-arrangements of flights as months went by; as to be expected when you secure a ccheap booking for a flight of this length.However, what resulted was a cancellation of my ticket, meaning I had to self-fund my way to Singapore to pick-up the remaining flights. There was little-to-no-help from the agent to help resolve this issue, meaning the week before I was due to fly I was scrambling the internet to find alternative flight arrangements.26 hours before I was due to return to the UK from Canada I checked the ticket issued on my app. It was all clear, and stated I could check-in 24 hours before the flight departure time. However, when I tried to check-in 2.5 hours later (i.e. 23.5 hours before the departure), the flight had disappeared from my booking. There had been no communication from GoToGate.com that this was getting cancelled, nor were any flight re-arrangements made from them. Instead, I had to contact the airline directly to make a new booking. By this time there was no room on my original flight, because GoToGate.com had not issued my ticket with the airline. As a result I had to return back to the UK 1.5 days later than planned, resulting in lost hours and therefore lost wages.My frustrations with GoToGate.com are 2-fold. Firstly, their customer service was not up-to-scratch. I was constantly told to contact the airline myself - is this not what I paid an agent fee for? Secondly, there was an inability to re-arrange flight bookings, meaning that if I had not resolved the situation myself, I would've missed out on the entire trip.As the agency work with airlines, I have been told that I will not be eligible for a refund as the flights ran as scheduled. That is understandable, however my issue is with GoToGate.com directly, as it was them who did not issue the tickets in the first place. I have been told that there is no process for compensation from the agency, and that I have no claim. As a result the onus is on me to look into Legal Acitivty, in order to bring damages against GoToGate.com, as I am entitled to partial refund of my trip.",1,Negative,wish be not write review arei book aroundtheworld trip gotogatecom arrange flight ukauscanuk book early rearrangement flight month went expect secure ccheap booking flight lengthhowever result cancellation ticket mean selffund way singapore pickup remain flight littletonohelp agent help resolve issue mean week due fly scramble internet find alternative flight arrangement hour due return uk canada check ticket issue app clear state could checkin hour flight departure time however try checkin hour later ie hour departure flight disappear book communication gotogatecom getting cancel flight rearrangement make instead contact airline directly make new booking time room original flight gotogatecom issue ticket airline result return back uk day later plan result lose hour therefore lose wagesmy frustration gotogatecom fold firstly customer service uptoscratch constantly tell contact airline pay agent fee secondly inability rearrange flight booking mean resolve situation would ve miss entire tripas agency work airline tell eligible refund flight run schedule understandable however issue gotogatecom directly issue ticket first place tell process compensation agency claim result onus look legal acitivty order bring damage gotogatecom entitle partial refund trip

"WITHOUT PREJUDICE!I’ve paid $109 for an e-visa from the Simple Visa ad as recommended (apparently) by GOTOGATE. I have twice been sucked into (duh) using Simple to NOT get an e-visa.

So, if not expert at this DIY e-visa idea, DO NOT USE SIMPLE because this is not a sure way to get a visa. I have alerted the ACCC who will look into my Simple Visa complaint.

"I cannot even begin to put into words how horrifying the customer service with this company is. I cancelled my ticket 2 and a half MONTHS ago, and till this date I am yet to receive a refund. Every time , I have contacted them they tell me that they are waiting on the refund from the airline but when I speak to the airline directly they tell me the money would have been refunded to them 21 working days from the time it was requested. I then after calling them time and time again they told me that they have in fact received the refund from the airline and it will take 3-5 business days for it to be returned to my account and of course this didn’t happen. So, when I contacted them back to ask why this money hasn’t been refunded I was told they will have to escalate it to the refund team to see why it hasn’t been processed to my account and that I would be contacted with an update. Did I get contacted with an update??? Of course I didn’t. So again and again I had to keep calling them to see what was happening how they could possibly have my money but are refusing to refund me. Then the next news I received I could not have even predicted, after being told on numerous occasions that the money was now with gotogate and it’s waiting to be returned to me, a gentleman on the phone now says this was never the case that they had never received the money and are still waiting for emirates to return the money to them. I was completely dumbfounded, lost for words, I don’t know what to believe or what to do any more but this is an absolute joke. They are THIEVES and LIARS.

"I had an extremely negative encounter with Gotogate. They impose numerous hidden charges, and if you spend more than 5 minutes on a page, they inflate the amount by 13,000 INR. Furthermore, they processed my credit card transaction without requiring an OTP, which raises serious security concerns. This application appears to lack proper security measures, with anyone potentially able to use your credit or debit card for bookings without OTP verification. In addition, their customer service leaves much to be desired.

"Spent a couple of hours last night trying to book a return trip to Cairo with two separate airlines. The outbound flight didn't have hold baggage included, the return one did - I ticked the option to buy 1 x outbound baggage but GotoGate applied it to each journey, with no option to correct? After comparison searches the prices were still the most competitive, but once I'd decided to book, at point of confirming purchase, an alert popped up saying the airlines had increased the ticket price by approx £70. I went back, did the search again, pressed 'buy' and another alert tells me the price has gone up by a further £70? It did this a third time in the space of one evening...no airline revises prices this frequently!

"Had an awful experience with Gotogate in 2021. I found great tickets to Morocco for November and immediately booked through Gotogate on a Ryanair flight. Due to recently introduced covid restrictions Ryanair cancelled the flight and issued passengers a refund, Gotogate emailed regarding the cancelled flight and refused to issue a refund. After weeks of chasing they advised that their admin costs outweighed the cost I paid for the flight. Why I would be responsible for their admin fees when Ryanair cancelled the flight and issued refunds I’m unsure.

The refund has still not been executed.Turkish Airlines informed us a month ago that the refund has been processed and the money transferred to Booking.com/ Gotogate.When we ask Booking.com / Gotogate when the money will be transferred to our bank account we receive answers, like:Booking.com: ‘Your refund request has already been escalated to our payout department and once this is done they will send the update for the same to your email’ and the latest on 28 September 2023: ‘We would like to inform that your case remains with our customer service, which is still working on your refund’.Gotogate: ‘We are currently experiencing a high volume of emails from our customers, which unfortunately, causing longer response times than usual (…) The refund request is already been escalated to the concerned team, requesting you to wait for updates.’ Another mail, 7 September 2023: ‘Following your request we checked your order and we can confirm to you that the process for your refund is on the last steps. You are kindly requested to be a bit more patient and you will be contacted by the respective team once your money is sent to your account”It is today 30 September 2023, four months after the cancellation, more than a month after Turkish Airlines confirmed that the money has been transferred to Booking.com / Gotogate; the money has still not been sent to our bank account.Several hours after I submitted above review Gotogate gave a reaction, see below, wherein Gotogate falsely blames the airline. Apparently Gotogate did not read my text well: After several phone calls and email exchange Turkish Airlines confirmed that the refund had been processed, the money transferred. The mail of Turkish Airlines, 3 September 2023: ‘When we checked your refund process, we found that your refund was successfully completed by Turkish Airlines.For the delay of the refund, please contact your bank with the ARN code that we will declare to you below.ARN code : 05306683166910008011614We present it to your information.’The money is apparently on the bank account of Booking.com / Gotogate and should be transferred to our bank account without further delay or vague statements.",1,Negative,partner book ticket hanoiamsterdam amsterdamjakarta turkish airline cancel flight early june due family circumstance booking do bookingcom apparently partner gotogate cost ticket would refunded minus costsit almost four month later refund still executedturkish airline inform we month ago refund process money transfer bookingcom gotogatewhen ask bookingcom gotogate money transfer bank account receive answer likebookingcom refund request already escalate payout department do send update email late september would like inform case remain customer service still work refundgotogate currently experience high volume email customer unfortunately cause long response time usual refund request already escalate concerned team request wait update another mail september follow request check order confirm process refund last step kindly request bit patient contact respective team money send accountit today september four month cancellation month turkish airline confirm money transfer bookingcom gotogate money still send bank accountseveral hour submit review gotogate give reaction see wherein gotogate falsely blame airline apparently gotogate read text well several phone call email exchange turkish airline confirm refund process money transfer mail turkish airline september check refund process find refund successfully complete turkish airlinesfor delay refund please contact bank arn code declare belowarn code present informationthe money apparently bank account bookingcom gotogate transfer bank account without delay vague statement

"I booked a flight with them and I am 100% sure I did not put a flexible ticket into my basket. However, when I received the final confirmation email, it was suddenly there - for CHF 250 more. I called the customer service line, but no matter which number I selected, it just kept on playing the same options and ignored my selection and it was not possible to reach anyone - I am sure this is on purpose. I found the number of the headquarters and called an English hotline. They told me that I had fallen into the trap. The flexible option is not cancellable and they would not help me. Then they offered to cancel the flight for CHF 84, only to call me later that even that was not possible. Companies like this should go bankrupt!I forgot to mention that they offer you 35 CHF discount for using Sofortzahlung, but then they do not accept it from any bank (tried Revolut and UBS), claiming the maximum amount has been exceeded.

"My experience is really bad with this website. I booked my flight from delhi to london which got delay and lately got cancelled due to techincal fault. Upon cancellation the airline informed that passanger can get refund for their tickets completely. But for those who has booked with other travel agency website then it will be their travel agency support who can help with the cancellation. I contact gotogate support of chat and phone. Support number for India doesn’t work, calling on their number for several time they are not able to hear me. I have tried calling from 4 different mobiles and carrier connection but same issue. Then over chat support I tried to talk to executives and they kept me teliing that they dont have any update on their side hence I need to contact airline in order to get refund.Then I contacted Luftansa airline they told me that these travel agency have their agency sypport number with airline where they can call the airline directly to check about the changes/cancellation and why aren’t gotogate contacting the airline. Luftansa support clearly told me that gotogate is washing their hands off. They are scaming me and dont want to process my refund since they cancelled the flight and the gotogate is already having my money and holding it on their side.Gotogate support hasn’t listened me all day complaining about my flight cancellation and refund. I was treated like pendulum in between luftansa support and gotogate support. Stuck with the situation, I am aware and its clearly mentioned by airline if tickets are booked via travel agency then only they will be able to process refund.But gotogate are not contact to airline in order to check about issue and cancellation of my flight.

"I wrote a review on 25 July regarding the preposterous delay to my flight refund, which was cancelled on 16 February 2023 - 223 days ago!Imagine the lawsuit if you owed a company £1,732 for this much time and ignored their letters. On 28 July, I was informed that the airline had refunded the money back to Gotogate and now I would just have to wait a few days to receive the £1,732.06.Repeated calls resulted in mixed messages. Some operators would try to tell me ""we have not received the refund"" until I gave them the exact dates and times that I was told otherwise, and they would return to ""oh yes I can see now... please wait a few more days"".This company is trained to mislead you and delay you until you eventually give up. But £1,732 is a huge amount of money that, because it has been taken from me and is now being withheld, is causing problems in my personal life. I will not give up on this case but I am increasingly frustrated by the complete lack of care by customer service for my situation.They have had my money for 2 months, which I'm sure they are gaining interest on, and are all but refusing to give it back to me. I am repeatedly told ""the case has been escalated to the highest department, I am escalating it again now"" but when I call back, a colleague tells me ""sorry but there is no update from your last call, so they didn't escalate it. However I will do it now.""Until the next day when I call again to verify, and find the same answer. It just feels like they deliberately send you in circles until they eventually get to keep your money.Now that the initial excuse of ""we haven't received the money from the airline yet"" can't be used, and the blame can't be passed, they seem even more unwilling to help to resolve the situation. The department that deals with refunds cannot be contacted, no complaint information can be given, and I am forced to continuously get back in touch with customer service. I am asked every time: ""please, you don't need to call us, we will be in touch with you in a few days"" but I have never - *NEVER* - been informed of an update without first having to call to drag it out of the person on the phone. There has been no proactiveness from anybody at Gotogate and nothing has ever been told to me that didn't take four phone calls to find out.So, they are not asking me ""please, don't call, we'll get in touch with you"" because they are busy and processing the issue. They are asking so I stop calling, forget about the case, and with no evidence of intending to give me any information.223 days and counting. I hope I will not be writing this at 8 months, 9 months, 10 month intervals, but I will pursue this for years if needs be.Please, save yourselves the stress - avoid these thieves and book direct.EDIT SINCE GOTOGATE'S REPLY BELOW:Gotogate have confirmed they have received the refund from the airline as of 26th July. This has been corroborated by multiple staff members at Gotogate. Therefore the comment below regarding ""it takes __ to get the money back from the airline"" is irrelevant. The money is now in Gotogate's account and has been for two months - still, nowhere to be seen for me.It's a ridiculous response that goes to show their carelessness for customers.

"Do not book with this company - it is absolutely not worth any saving they may offer. I booked a flight to Athens in June 2022, the flight was cancelled by Wiz air. Wiz immediately processed my refund to GoToGate, the booking agent. However they denied this and said Wiz air had to transfer a refund to me personally, this was not true. After chasing GoToGate relentlessly (there is no phone number, all comms have to be over email), they responded 11 months later telling me I had to pay an admin fee for any refund and they gave ME bank details to transfer MORE funds into. GoToGate have a .co.uk email address however all customer service is outsourced to India. It has now been 15 months since my flight was cancelled and I haven't received a penny.This is possibly the worst company I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with.

I booked a flight through Go To Gate for September 22, 2023, only to be denied boarding at Riyadh Airport due to an airline policy change.

Go To Gate offered no support during this ordeal.When I contacted their customer service, they were not just unhelpful but shockingly rude, denying any responsibility.

However they were later unable to confirm the alternative flights and kept saying they were ""still waiting to have confirmation from the airline"". I only found this out via repeated calls to GoToGate, so not sure at what point I would have been notified otherwise. Incidentally I also called the airline who said there were alternatives but they couldn't rebook for me as I had to go through the agent.Anyway after several painful conversations with customer service, GoToGate are now saying the only option they can offer is cancellation as rescheduling is no longer available, however they cannot refund 100%, I still have to pay tax and charges which is over 50% of cost ""due to airline policy"" when they obviously messed up their end.This whole joke is costing me upwards of £450 not to mention having to rebook new flights at the last minute.

"If I could give 0 I would. I wish I checked reviews on this service before I used it. We were due to fly out Tuesday morning with it taking two flights to get to our destination. Friday we received a text saying that part of our flight was cancelled. My partner called gotogate at first they said that they would let us know in 3 days what was happening and when my partner explained that it was 3 days until we were meant to fly out the ""supervisor"" assured us we were back on the cancelled flight.Monday night we go to check in and are informed that that same part of the flight is canceled.

I have been on the phone and chatted with several people and spend hours explaining the situation over and over again because they refuse to send me e-mails or anything else about the status of my case and the informations I submitted.After answering the same questions over and over again they just claim that some rare technical error occured and that my money will be refunded shortly. Nothing has happened yet.Our Bank is now also on the case trying to get the money back. So far without succes. I want to report GO TO GATE to the police for theft of my 1000 USD but I dont know how.

"I had never used Go To Gate, but assumed that they were decent as they were recommended on Skyscanner.  Initially Opodo offered the lowest price for my return flights from London to Porto but their price went up by £30+ AND then a further £40+ while I was attempting to book.  Go To Gate's price had also risen, but not by much; they were the new cheapest hence why I gave them a try.Booking process straightforward (although I never enjoy the endless prompts of add-ons) and my details were seamlessly transferred to TAP Portugal by Go To Gate.  I would definitely use again if they offer a low price for a flight I want.",5,Positive,never use go gate assume decent recommend skyscanner initially opodo offer low price return flight london porto price went attempt book go gate price also rise much new cheap hence give trybooking process straightforward although never enjoy endless prompt addon detail seamlessly transfer tap portugal go gate would definitely use offer low price flight want

"I ordered a ticket 6 months before my journey. 5 days before my trip started, flybillett cancelled my whole trip because the first of 3 (6 in total) flights were cancelled. I could easily have been rebooked on the first flight and kept the rest of the flights.After 10 calls back and forth between flybillett and the airline, Flybillett finally agreed to rebook to the day before my original flight.

I even went to the airport, and they could see that my flight was not done properly by Flybillett. Whenever I called Flybillett customer service, they said they were on it and I even got an e-mail asking me to trust them and not contact them anymore on e-mail, phone or social media. But they never did anything. I just managed to get on my flight after calling the airline, who issued a ticket a few minutes before the flight closed.

"I don't like to leave bad reviews in general, but I feel I have to make an exception here. Following the earthquake in Morocco, my flight with the airline needed to be cancelled/rescheduled. I called Go To Gate and found it disturbing they were asking me to contact the airline directly and request vouchers, given I had booked with Go To Gate not the Airline. Having called the airline they were extremely helpful, and advised I would have 15 days to reschedule and this information would be published soon on their website, which it was within 24 hours.What followed was what appears to me Go To Gate using my voucher for themselves. They refused to acknowledge the information in the airline website for all agents saying they'd 'email them'. This was strange given on my first call the excuse was the airline hadnt published anything. When they did, Gotogate decided it now required an email. I made over 20 calls requesting the 15 days grace to reschedule, they kept repeating what appeared to me to be  scripted lines and not even responding to my concerns above choosing to be silent and at the end repeating the same line again. I was also given assurances it'd be dealt with though I realised this would be highly unlikely given my experiences.As soon as the 15 days passer they magically called me and advised the time had passed.I travel frequently, and they will not be getting my business again in future. Essentially over £500 they have missed many more bookings worth alot more.

"Dear Gotogate Customer Service,Main Concern: Paid for Business class, refunded with economy class with unreasonable delays.I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the level of service provided regarding the refund process for my partner's cancelled flight with Air India on the 29th of July 2023. The ticket for this flight was booked via Booking.com, which ultimately involved your company, Gotogate.Below, I have outlined the sequence of events to provide clarity:- 29th July 2023: Flight cancelled by Air India. They confirmed 100% refund eligibility.- 30th July 2023: Contacted Gotogate for refund initiation. Assured processing had begun.- Approx. 14 days later: No refund received. On calling Gotogate, was informed the process would ""start now"".- Another 14 days: Was told by Gotogate that no refund was seen as approved by Air India. However, Air India reconfirmed a 100% refund approval from their end on 30th July.I took the initiative to bridge the communication gap between Air India and Gotogate, which resulted in a Gotogate representative acknowledging the refund approval. This highlights inefficiencies in your communication and internal processes.After an additional 16 days, I received an email from Booking.com indicating the approval of my refund, but only for 48% of the total amount paid. The refund I received only covered the initial cost of an economy ticket, neglecting the additional payment made for the upgrade to Business Class.Major Concerns:- Inadequate Communication: Clear gaps in communication between Gotogate and Air India resulted in extended delays.- Lack of Proactive Service: Gotogate representatives failed to take necessary actions without external intervention.- Incomplete Refund: Despite all the difficulties, the refund received is only partial, not recognizing the upgrade payment.The ordeal has caused significant inconvenience, both in terms of time and the emotional strain of navigating these complexities while managing personal and professional responsibilities.In this age of advanced technology, including AI, databases, and high-speed computing, such inconsistencies and inefficiencies in service are unexpected and unacceptable.I kindly request the following actions:- A thorough investigation into the discrepancies in the refund process.- Immediate processing of the balance refund, accounting for the Business Class upgrade payment.- An acknowledgment of the inconvenience caused, accompanied by a tangible solution to ensure such oversights are not repeated in the future.Your prompt attention to this matter will be greatly appreciated. I await your timely response.Sincerely,Impacted Customer[Update on 20th September 2023]: Gotogate reply to review states that I am fully compensated, but it is not true, I paid nearly 2172 Euro including upgrade to business class, but refund email only says 942 Euro will be refunded. I am still missing 1230 Euro for the Business class upgrade. This clearly shows that gotogate's accounting system has serious errors. I have confirmation from etraveli.com (a gotogate entity) on the Business class upgrade which was paid on 26th July, 2023.I would request Gotogate to look into this matter properly, or I have to use my receipts, tickets and ask EU or CZ Customer Protection agencies to raise a legal claim Dispute along with reasonable compensation for wasting time and efforts.",1,Negative,dear gotogate customer servicemain concern pay business class refund economy class unreasonable delaysi writing express dissatisfaction level service provide regard refund process partner cancel flight air india th july ticket flight book via bookingcom ultimately involve company gotogatebelow outline sequence event provide clarity th july flight cancel air india confirm refund eligibility th july contact gotogate refund initiation assure processing begin approx day later refund receive call gotogate inform process would start another day tell gotogate refund see approve air india however air india reconfirm refund approval end th julyi take initiative bridge communication gap air india gotogate result gotogate representative acknowledging refund approval highlight inefficiencie communication internal processesafter additional day receive email bookingcom indicate approval refund total amount pay refund receive covered initial cost economy ticket neglect additional payment make upgrade business classmajor concern inadequate communication clear gap communication gotogate air india result extend delay lack proactive service gotogate representative fail take necessary action without external intervention incomplete refund despite difficulty refund receive partial recognizing upgrade paymentthe ordeal cause significant inconvenience term time emotional strain navigate complexity manage personal professional responsibilitiesin age advanced technology include ai database highspeed computing inconsistency inefficiency service unexpected unacceptablei kindly request follow action thorough investigation discrepancy refund process immediate processing balance refund accounting business class upgrade payment acknowledgment inconvenience cause accompany tangible solution ensure oversight repeat futureyour prompt attention matter greatly appreciated await timely responsesincerelyimpacte customerupdate th september gotogate reply review state fully compensate true pay nearly euro include upgrade business class refund email say euro refund still miss euro business class upgrade clearly show gotogate accounting system serious error confirmation etravelicom gotogate entity business class upgrade pay th july would request gotogate look matter properly use receipt ticket ask eu cz customer protection agency raise legal claim dispute along reasonable compensation waste time effort

"Buyer beware! Had a recent negative experience with the staff and online customer service circus cancelling flights with the GoToGate (India office). The flights were advertised with a clearly stated cancellation/refund option (the reason the flights were bought)and now GoToGate will not honour this. They are hiding behind airline rules as a third party when it is their group or booking.com's mistake for false advertising. The agent I spoke with refused to give me their last name, escalate the call to a manager or provide and address to direct complaints. The airlines cancellation rules were not available at the time of purchase only the ""dummy"" refund promise on the confirmation. This is false advertising and quite frankly stealing. There is no way to make a formal complaint except to physically write to their headoffices/CEO, go down a legal route or to report them to trading standards and action fraud in the UK. Their customer service contacts online divert you to the same office office and workers that have no authority and see no issue with the mis selling of airfare to customers.

This will result in a refund in 14 days for consumers having bought their ticket through an online travel agency.

"WouToday's day the online travel agents have been very competitive and this one, just being dodgy. The only reason I purchased from them was the fare price. During the booking process, I was asked if I would like to select my seats then I did and paid for it. After the booking was finalised, I went to the airline's website trying to confirm my booking and surprisingly found out that the seats weren't reversed. I had to reserve the seats by myself, though the seats that I selected were free. I called Gotogate 3 times, the first rep sent me a link asking me to submit the complaints which I did, and the second time I call they said I have to wait. After 3 weeks of purchase, the third rep advised that the seat reservation fees were meant to be their mark up. How ridiculous this thing could be! It just taught me that we never pay anything beyond the fare and tax price. Do not fall into these traps.Update: there was no T&C alerts at the time or booking. Gotogate phone representative even admitted that the seat reservation fees would be their mark up.

"My experience with Gotogate was marred by what I can only describe as excessive and unjustified charges. Not only did I have to pay for the changes I needed to make to my trip, but the additional fees imposed seemed to be significantly higher than what I've encountered with other booking websites. It felt like an unnecessary financial burden.It's essential for customers to have confidence that they're being charged fairly and reasonably for any modifications to their travel plans. Unfortunately, my experience with Gotogate left me feeling like they were exploiting the situation, turning a simple change into a costly ordeal. This practice of overcharging customers for basic adjustments is a significant concern and should be addressed to ensure a fair and transparent booking process.",1,Negative,experience gotogate marred describe excessive unjustified charge pay change need make trip additional fee impose seem significantly high I ve encounter book website feel like unnecessary financial burdenit essential customer confidence they re charge fairly reasonably modification travel plan unfortunately experience gotogate leave feeling like exploit situation turn simple change costly ordeal practice overcharge customer basic adjustment significant concern address ensure fair transparent booking process

"I used to be a travel agent and heard horror stories about go to gate all the time, but I had the impression that as bad as they were, it always had something to do with the customer changing their ticket in some way. So when I saw a cheap ticket and knew there was no way I was changing it, I thought I’d give it a go.Long story short:-airline cancels that tickets return flight-go to gate don’t tell me, luckily I check airline website.-no big deal, i call go to gate to collect refund or rebook-g2g are a bit elusive, say airline havn’t refunded money-call airline, they are baffled and say g2g have the money- call g2g about 20 times, they tell me many different things, but always that i will have a return flight, don’t worry etc.- getting to be days away from my flight, I just have to buy a new one- call g2g another 20 or so times, really strange lies each time, mostly ‘your refund will come through in a few weeks’, but keep hanging up on me, and organise times to call but never actually call,-It’s been 6 months now, I guess next step is going to consumer affairs?-  btw we booked on Amex, which we assumed would be a great back up, but even Amex with their usually good refund policy are in a grey spot with booking agencies, so no luck there.So if you are thinking g2g are ok if you’re not going to change your tix, be aware that the problems emerge even if the airline changes the tix.This is kind of minor compared to the massive loss of money and stress of being stuck somewhere, but the call centre people are terrible, really unsettlingly false and difficult to speak with.Update: Please refer to the response from g2g below as an example. Yes I would love to give you a chance to deliver the 'service I expect'.  A wonderful way to do that would be to refund me the cost of the flight that was cancelled, as per the booking conditions.",1,Negative,use travel agent hear horror story go gate time impression bad always something customer change ticket way see cheap ticket know way change think i d give golong story shortairline cancel ticket return flightgo gate do not tell luckily check airline websiteno big deal call go gate collect refund rebookgg bit elusive say airline havnt refunded moneycall airline baffle say gg money call gg time tell many different thing always return flight do not worry etc get day away flight buy new one call gg another time really strange lies time mostly refund come week keep hang organise time call never actually callits month guess next step go consumer affair btw book amex assume would great back even amex usually good refund policy grey spot booking agency luck thereso think gg ok you re go change tix aware problem emerge even airline change tixthis kind minor compare massive loss money stress stick somewhere call centre people terrible really unsettlingly false difficult speak withupdate please refer response gg example yes would love give chance deliver service expect wonderful way would refund cost flight cancel per book condition

"We booked flights via Sky Scanner with Air Canada via GoToGate as they were marginally cheaper than Air Canada direct. There were 2 sectors from Vancouver to Toronto and then on to Manchester UK, we booked Premium Economy. A month prior to the flight, we were informed the aircraft was being changed and chartered to Omni Air, the new aircraft did not have a Premium Cabin, so we were being downgraded. We were advised to contact GoToGate after the flight with refund authorisation forms from Air Canada to then claim back from GoToGate. When we returned, we received the forms from Air Canada very quickly, we e-mailed them to GoToGate immediately and I contact them via webchat to inform them that we needed the fare difference between premium economy to economy refunding ($811 CAD). We’ve still not received the money, I have contacted them more than 12 times to explain the problem, the only e-mail I have had from them was to say they won’t refund a spent flight (I was asking for the fare difference from the downgrade not the full flight!).

"A few weeks before our holiday started, Gotogate informed that our return flight was delayed. These things kan happen but they provided only 1 “alternative” flight of a flight that departs 2 days (!) later. Since we can’t be home 2 days later, this is not an option. Also the refund option is crazy, Gotogate doesn’t know what the refund amount is and when they pay it. Since we need to fly back, we called and mailed Gotogate so many times to ask for better alternatives. We requested multiple alternatives on different time slots, even with extra stops. They say on the phone they will check it, but in the end..  we do not hear anything from them. It’s so frustrating that we are on holiday but have no clue when we go back… Thanks Gotogate for NOT helping us. I would never recommend you to all our friends and family. Its ridiculous.Response based on reply Gotogate:- Thanks for your reply. Of course we understand that Gotogate is not responsible for the delay of the flight.

Had a very poor experience with Gotogate. Booked return flights from Sydney on Malaysian Airlines. Opted for Checked  baggage of 30kg and paid for it. Hours later got an email saying due to a system error the extra baggage could not be confirmed and that the checked baggage money would be refunded. When I tried to add the Checked baggage through Malaysian website the cost for it exceeded the original ticket price. Called Malaysian and they advised me that this was a scam and that they do receive a lot of these complaints. So called Gotogate a few times to resolve and the only sensible option they could give was to cancel the ticket because it was all within a few hours of the original booking. But they dicked me a so called handling fee.Looks like that this is a earn easy money tactic with some websites amidst some real ticket sales. Tough lesson learnt.Update on 18 Sep 2023: What made it worse was that not only the ticket had to be cancelled and I had to look elsewhere but the fact that there was a so called handling fee. This despite the fact that Gotogate were not able to provide what they had advertised and also that the cancellation was within the same day for which most websites don't charge any cancellation fee even if it was the customer who had changed his mind for whatever reason. So if Gotogate cared about me the Customer in any real sense they should refund me the handling fee...Thanks,1,Negative,poor experience gotogate book return flight sydney malaysian airline opt check baggage kg pay hour later get email say due system error extra baggage could confirm check baggage money would refund try add check baggage malaysian website cost exceed original ticket price call malaysian advise scam receive lot complaint call gotogate time resolve sensible option could give cancel ticket within hour original booking dicke call handle feelook like earn easy money tactic website amidst real ticket sale tough lesson learntupdate sep make bad ticket cancel look elsewhere fact call handling fee despite fact gotogate able provide advertise also cancellation within day website do not charge cancellation fee even customer change mind whatever reason gotogate cared customer real sense refund handle feethank

"Currently in the process of 'attempting' to make a simple name change to a booked flight. It's taken four days to get somebody to even (what I'm assuming now to be obfuscating tactics) escalate the problem.I've been disconnected endlessly and passed from pillar to post. Told to 'contact the airline' 'we've passed controll of the ticket to the airline and it's no longer ours to manage' and even 'You'll be able to fly with the current name'Nobody has given me a proper response to something as SIMPLE as changing the mistake, which the airline has repeatedly assured me can be done by them simply contacting them directly. They themselves apologised that they couldn't help further in changing it for me as I had booked through Booking.com and therefore the ticket holder needed to initiate the ammendment. Which I later found out was GoToGate.After being lied to endlessly, I have nothing more I can do but call to plead the changes are made before the date on the flight. I was estimated a response time for name changes takes around TWO WEEKS.

They have requested that I call them back on the 14th to  'see how things were progressing'I'm supposedly due to fly in two weeks time and this was the estimated time for the 'airlines response'.

"Please please do not use Gotogate for airline tickets, holidays - anything.  They are awful.  I have been trying to cancel my airline tickets for almost a month as the airline (Loganair) changed our outward flight, meaning I would have to pay for extra nights etc.  GTG have been utterly appalling. Their system has STILL not updated any changes made.  I have explained the situation to them on so many occasions but they still do not acknowledge that there is an issue.   They have told me I need to deal with the airline, so I have and they have agreed a full refund. But GTG have still not actioned this request.  My flight is less than 2 weeks away and their system still shows the wrong dates.  And still shows that I am flying.  They have said they are on it but the airline has categorically denied any discussion with them.  So here I am £700 down, expected to accept a flight back from Norway when I can't get there in the first place. I implore you do not use them.  Don't believe them when they say they are 'on it'.

"**PLEASE TAKE NOTICE** THIS COMPANY PUT MY CHILD'S HEALTH AT RISK. DO NOT USE AT ALL COSTS!This is a fraudulent company. I've just reported them to UK Trading Standards and hope to see them dissolved.When reading the reviews I was wary of using them but thought not much could go wrong. I had originally booked with TUI but UK air traffic control issues meant the holiday was cancelled, so I needed a last minute flight to Thailand asap. They sneakily made my buy excess baggage, then said the charges are non refundable. I thought 'you got me but okay"". My son suffered with health complications and requires machinery, its very heavy to transport but with the excess baggage, we thought we carry our own and cancel renting some in Thailand.When we got to the airport, we were told by Oman Air that no excess baggage had been added to our tickets and we would have to pay again and double the price (around £400) so we had to leave the healthcare machinery behind, as after spending 5k on a replacement holiday, we had no Sterling left and only Baht we booked to pick up in Thailand. When we arrived in Thailand we were unable to hire out the required equipment until a day before we were due to leave. So we've been unable to enjoy any moment, as were constantly worried my son might suffer an attack.These crooks refused to even refund and then told me that they'd send an email with a form. No email or form arrived.I don't even want the money anymore, I want to see these crooks punished. I spoke to a Sujata Budha who was extremely unhelpful, but this is typical of the company.

"Awful. Dreadful. Time wasted. Money wasted.This kind of operation should be criminal. I booked a flexible flight (paid the extra fee for free changes). After going around and around to actually find a number that worked, I reached them basically to be lectured during the call for using this service. First they couldn't find a new ticket, then they had to remind me, oh yes, so we won't charge you a ""penalty"". Rebooked after much waiting, so I thought.Finally after paying the fare difference I was promised a follow up email. My previous flight was cancelled at the airline (the booking number is no longer valid), Go To Gate's page shows the old ticket and date. No follow up email, no booking apparently and now I'm out the original ticket price and the extra fee with no clue if I have a ticket or not.I say this service shouldn't exist because... they get these prices by buying tickets in bulk presumably. The reason I had to book with them in the first place is because, there was an internet error when I was attempting to book the same flight with the airline, and by the time I resolved it, someone else had booked it. I went to Booking.com and then booked through these crooks, where the same time and date I was looking for was available. Why? Of course because they had bought it up in bulk.

"I was stuck at the airport, missed my flight... I had to buy a ticket online quickly and at a reasonable price. I did a quick check online and purchased tickets through this site. I ordered without knowing if this is a reliable site or not. A risk of those who have no choice.

All seems good when booking. Can call and met with helpful advisers.Failed to inform me I would require a visa even when questioned. Flew out LGW to JED where my problems started. I needed a transit visa as my next stop would be RUH. All agents are made aware of this by Saudi Airlines. Obviously GoToGate didn't inform me this and when questioned said I shouldn't have needed a visa. I spoke to both Saudi Airlines and the Saudi embassy who both gave the same answer. 2 domestic stops inside Saudi Arabia requires a transit visa regardless of duration and all agents booking these flights are fully aware of this. Also my return from from JED to LGW was changed to JED to LHR. Very unhelpful when any problems arise and will tell you to call the embassy or the airline .,1,Negative,seem good booking call meet helpful advisersfaile inform would require visa even question fly lgw jed problem start need transit visa next stop would ruh agent make aware saudi airline obviously gotogate do not inform question say should not need visa speak saudi airlines saudi embassy gave answer domestic stop inside saudi arabia require transit visa regardless duration agent book flight fully aware also return jed lgw change jed lhr unhelpful problem arise tell call embassy airline

They somehow manged to lose our flight that had been changed and the flight that they were going to book us on. We were then told to cancel the whole booking and re-book new tickets. GoToGate then told us that they would start the refund process for us. It has been almost two months and the only time GoToGate have chased Etihad is when we chase them!

"Terrible experience with gotogate, I will never use them again. It is interesting to see how they only respond to positive reviews and not the negative ones which are plenty!Making changes to your booking is a nightmare even though flight amendments are allowed within ticket conditions. I was told by the customer rep that they are only allowed to check 2 viable other trip dates and if they are not suitable you have to interact with the airlines yourself to find a date to change to. Makes it fun when it is multiple airlines. Even if you interact with them you cannot change the booking directly and have to engage gotogate to do it. By the time you talk to all the different airlines and gotogate the flight dates and availability have most likely changed. So overall, an unachievable task.

We went there, paid the penalty and when we asked why we had to go in, they sent us somewhere else, which made it even more complicated for us to get to the plane on time.

When I called to clarify, they said ""someone will call you"".  They could not give me a day or time when someone will get back to me, and the trip is coming up fast.  I will never, NEVER book flights through booking.com again.  Their unresponsive and difficult customer service are deplorable.EDIT- We never actually got the flight confirmation from them. I had to take a morning out of our family vacation to go to the airport and have them search for our booking at the airline customer desk.  At no time did booking.com provide accurate information, and in fact told me that we had changed the ticket (we did not and have the receipt to prove it), and therefore we’re responsible to figure it out.

"DO NOT book a flight through Gotogate who are in partnership with Booking.com Until now my experience with Booking.com had always been great - that was booking accommodation. Booking a flight however, has been a complete disaster because they use Gotogate.My wife and I had to cancel our honeymoon due to a complication with pregnancy and the airline permitted a refund minus the cancellation fee. However, Gotogate and Booking.com just won't give us any information about the status of the refund. They claim the airline have not responded - but don't even give a rough indication as to how long we'll need to wait. It's now been about 6 months and still nothing.Multiple customer service advisers have said they've escalated it as urgent but nothing ever happens. They show little empathy to our situation, especially considering it's a considerable sum of money that we're out of pocket. Even if they just gave us a rough timeframe that is better than nothing, but they would prefer that we're left in limbo, getting anxiety in the process.Save yourself the hassle and DO NOT buy a flight through Gotogate who are used by Booking.com** Update 5/9/23**I contacted Skyscanner (where we originally found the flights that we'd booked) to let them know that Booking.com and Gotogate were treating us terribly and could my feedback be taken onboard to warn other customers. Amazingly, they contacted Booking.com & Gotogate for me requesting an urgent update and a few hours later Gotogate contacted me to say:'Regrettably, I discovered that the email address used for communication with the airline was incorrect. Consequently, I have re-submitted a full refund request to Qatar Airways.'So for nearly 6 months their customer service team have been contacting the airline for a refund but using the wrong email address! If this is the case then why did the emails not bounce? And why did no one from the airline tell them where to redirect them to? Perhaps they could be lying?

"When I purchased the original flight from GoToGate, I purchased a ""Flexible Ticket"" - meaning I was allowed to change my flight once. I called their Customer Service department and requested to change my flight, and after the call, they sent me an updated itinerary of the new flight. However, this flight change was never actually forwarded to the airline. I called the airline (Japan Airlines) and they confirmed that they never received the change from GoToGate. Therefore, I was never able to take this flight, so it had to be canceled and refunded by the airline. I've tried calling GoToGate's customer service again and again, and every time, I am placed on hold and transferred at least 3 times. By the time I actually get to speak to someone, they hang up on me.GoToGate kept my money and now they refuse to help me because they claimed the reservation was canceled and they cannot make any amendments.

Then I discovered the night before I was due to return home that my flight home had been cancelled because I hadn’t turned up for the outgoing flight (despite being advised by Gotogate that being a no-show would be no problem). I was left stranded with no flight home. Had to rebook another flight at great expense through another company. Complained to Gotogate that night who said a manager would call me back and no one did. Then spent two months(!) calling and using the chat function to complain and request a refund. Customer service non existent!! They answer call, refuse to put you through to a manager, say they will get a supervisor to call back…..and then don’t.

"Eventually my rebooking was resolved to my satisfaction and at the end I had a very nice person on the phone. I am curious though, if I will get a refund. But it took me many, many phonicalls, until I had someone on the line, who a), spoke english that I could understand, b) wouldn't always break up - the line is horrible, probably due to ending up in India, c) didn't tell me that I should call back, because they have a technical issue. I was trying to rebook my flight, because I needed an earlier return flight to New York, because of a medical emergency. If I had booked with the airline directly, they would have accepted my letter from the hospital and probably waved the change fee. But not so with GoToGate. I had to pay the full change fee, which was almost 1000.- Dollars. Also, I tried to change it a month before I started my travel, but only had customer service personal on the phone, who didn't give me satisfactory information. When I called a second time, the flight details and price were different, when I called a third time to find out what is correct, the third person told me there was a technical issue, I should call back in an hour. I then called the airline directly and rebooked with them, which was cancelled a few days before the rebooked flight, because they said, I had to go through the agency that issued the ticket. So I did that, but it was so late, that the change fee was horribly high. I also have not received a refund for another flight from them.

The times when I managed to have a conversation(every time with a different person) I was being assured that everything will be fine, I just need to wait. Eventually I called the airline company because the date when I was as supposed to return was very close. From them I found out that my ticket was never flexible, I was just charged from Gotogate for the option…that’s why they could not change it. I lost my flight, and I had to buy another ticket. They said they will reimburse the ticket price(without the taxes)…is been more than 7months since and many other phone calls. I want to sue this company.

"It was very disappointing to find that the total price noted in the first glimpse of the flight info. ended up being only about half of the total we ended up paying.  Other than a personal item, everything else was charged extra (carry on, checked bag, seat choice, etc). It was also very misleading to have to book two one way tickets consecutively for the total round trip cost. Once I realized how much the extra charges would entail, I had already booked the departing flight and couldn't have one of them refunded. Cancelling the first ticket to rebook, I lost part of that in 'non-refundable' charges, though it still ended up being about $40 less than keeping things as they were and paying for a extra checked bag we decided against taking because of the high cost ={!!",2,Negative,disappointing find total price note first glimpse flight info end half total end pay personal item everything else charge extra carry check bag seat choice etc also mislead book two one way ticket consecutively total round trip cost realize much extra charge would entail already book depart flight could not one refunded cancel first ticket rebook lose part nonrefundable charge though still end less keep thing pay extra checked bag decide take high cost

"Book directly with airlines not Booking.Com or GoToGate as these companies withhold refunds.GoToGate is not passing on a refund for a flight even though the airline has written to GoToGate on the PNR to confirm to them that it is due in full. Their customer service is atrocious and I have had to continually call them - they keep telling me they will look into it and call me back but they don't.There is no email address for correspondence and no transparent escalation process or ability to write and record your complaint so you get trapped in a cycle of repetative phone calls with agents who are not empowered to help.I booked with them through Booking.Com thinking it would be convenient but it has been a nightmare.   It feels as though they have a deliberate policy to hold on to refunds as long as possible and their poor service is part of that. Always book direct with airlines. The airline my case has really tried to help me, they immediately took responsibility for the changed flight and swiftly offered a full refund and documented that.  But GoToGate are in the middle and not passing it on.If you google their service you will see many other examples of GoToGate doing exactly this to their customers.

"If you book a flight through Booking.com you are effectively booking with Go To Gate, which is now owned by booking.   My advice is to avoid at all costs.  Our flight within India was downgraded, so we cancelled and rebooked with another airline. That was in January.  Since then we’ve been trapped in an Indian call centre nightmare to obtain a refund.  Of the 12 times we’ve called them we are told ‘we are chasing the airline’, although the airline have confirmed that we are entitled to a refund, but that go to gate haven’t actually asked for it..?! Having spent £25,000+ with booking and currently a genius level 3 customer I’m appalled by the absolutely non existent service.  My advice to others would be to book directly with the Airline.  It might be more expensive, but then when things go wrong,  you don’t have to deal with an incompetent business like go to gate…",1,Negative,book flight bookingcom effectively book go gate own booking advice avoid cost flight within india downgrade cancel rebooke another airline january since we ve trap indian call centre nightmare obtain refund time we ve call tell chase airline although airline confirm entitle refund go gate have not actually ask spend book currently genius level customer I m appal absolutely non existent service advice other would book directly airline might expensive thing go wrong do not deal incompetent business like go gate
"Granted the flights were cheaper through Gotogate than directly through the airline but I guess you pay for what you get as they have informed me they cannot help me change the date of the return flight and suggested I contact the airline directly. The airline stated that because the booking was done via an 'agent' (Gtg) they have to make the change. As others have said, I am not too sure what the point of this company is other than serving as an unhelpful middleman. They do not reply to emails, only via the chat but there is no point to the chat when the person cannot assist you??!!

I booked all my trip with booking .com and I had no problems with the hotels or taxi service. However I would never book a flight with booking.com again as you don’t actually book with them. They use a third party called Gotogate. Air Indua changed the flight and dropped in a 15 hour layover instead of 3 hrs 40 mins. Naturally I wanted to change the flight. Oh my word it was impossible with go to gate! They are polite but tell you to keep calm they will sort things etc etc after seven days  I called Air India myself and they changed the flight. It was so stressful as there was only a fortnight to go. I then received an e mail from Gotogate telling me to call India and change the flight myself. They should have just been honest and said from day one that calling the Airline was the best thing to do.

"I booked a multi-city trip with go to gate, which encompassed three different airlines. One of the flights got changed (which I understand isn’t gotogates fault),  the customer service I received when trying to source an alternate flight was nothing less than terrible. I was then offered to cancel ‘free of charge’, which I did, and rebooked direct with the airlines. I was told that the refund process would take about 10 working days. After a month, I contacted the airline directly to start the refund process, as gotogate had not even started the process. I eventually received my refund today, but it took contacting gotogate everyday to get anything moving. And the CS team couldn’t care less.

Requested full refund for the trip and Gotogate refuses to issue it, claiming TAP is declining it. Called TAP directly and not only they said I was entitled to the refund, but also said that they have no record of Gotogate ever requesting it to begin with!!They won't even share the TAP's refund refusal email or ROR code for me to check it directly with TAP.I've been on the phone with several different people from Gotogate, some said I can get a partial refund, then all of the sudden I no longer have a right to any refund at all... back to maybe we can get something... ridiculous!!An operator called Krishan from the front office was super unpleasant, refusing to pass me on to a manager or to escalate the issue (13-Aug 3:34PM). Basically told me to call again the same number, so that I'd be someone else's problem. I was speechless.They keep talking about policies, when my rights are protected by law, which overrules any policy.I was also told that in some cases the airlines themselves will have issued the refund already, and Gotogate helds the money/vouchers on their end whilst making it very difficult for customers to get it, in hopes that people will either give up or forget about the whole thing, and they get to keep it....bear in mind this is hearsay, but from what I'm experiencing, I honestly wouldn't be surprised.The bottom line is, IT'S NOT WORTH IT.

I recently booked 3 tickets for me and my two kids. As a single mother at the time of booking I chose to purchase the front row seats as it would be convenient for my kids as they were travelling in the aircraft for the first time. The seating map on the aircraft showed that the seat numbers I got would be the front rows. So looking at the aircraft map I purchased my seats worth $660 cdn. As we boarded the flights (going and coming) I saw that they were actually the second rows not first. I contacted gotogate about them false advertising the seats and asking for a refund but got refused.  If we were to sit in the second row seats then we didn’t have to specifically purchase the seats as we could have sat anywhere and saved that money. Please don’t purchase specific seats as their info is not correct/current. At the time of check in it’s better to ask the aircraft staff for your seats if available and save some money. I would never purchase any more tickets with gotogate and I advice others not to do it either. There are so many other websites/apps that can be honest and give better deals.

"I got at Gotogate site via Kayak search. After booking tickets + paying extra fee for seats selection it turned out that seat selection was not a ""selection"" but just expressing the preferences.

This is the moment a binding contract between You and the relevant airline(s) has been concluded.3.1.3 Prices for the flight and seat availability are added directly in the Portal by the applicable airline. If changes are made by the airline that are outside of our control (e.g. price changes, seat availability or something else) and that occurs after a booking request has been made, but before the contract with the airline has become binding (as set out in Section 3.1.2 above), the contract will not enter into force and your payment will be refunded in full...""Excerpt from gotogate->travel-conditions-> Booking processI got email from Gotogate and exact places I've selected.Next, I got email from airline with completely different seats.Ok, (to paraphrase T&C) apparently changes were made by the airline that are outside of Gotogate control and that occurred after a booking request has been made, and AFTER the contract with the airline has become binding.Contacting Gotogate support ended with reply that seat selection is just a preference, and you should contact airline to follow up your case.However, I checked my reservation at airline site, and it turned out that places I ""bought"" from Gotogate were available (they are still available at the moment I write this review, two days after the booking!)Moreover, seats were allocated not for passengers selected in Gotogate order but for an adult and a kid. Why? There is a family seating policy at airline that let you select seats for adult + kids for free if you select those seats in given section of the plane.I've paid extra money for specific seat selection and although they were available, the booking via Gotogate resulted in seats reservation that are available for free. It was not a fare limitation I can still select preferred seats with my tariff for 50% of cost Gotogate charged me with.You're still reading.

"Subject: Flight Cancellation Refund Request - Order No: MEF19H I am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction and disappointment regarding the recent experience I had with the booking made through your platform.On August 5, 2023, I had a flight scheduled from Vancouver to Toronto with Lynx Air, departing at 11:10 PM. Unfortunately, when I attempted to check the flight status on Lynx Air's website, I was shocked to discover that my flight had been canceled.Immediately, I contacted your customer service through the phone, but I had to endure an extended waiting period before I could speak to a representative. After finally getting through, I was informed that my flight was rebooked, and an email was sent to me notifying about travel documents too. However, upon arriving at the airport for my flight, I was informed by the airline's counter that my name was not registered for any flight, and there was no booking under my name.To rectify the situation, the airline's representative contacted Gotogate on my behalf, and they confirmed that it would take up to three days to investigate the matter. Unfortunately, there were no available flights for the same day, and I had no choice but to purchase a new ticket, incurring substantial financial losses and causing significant inconvenience.",1,Negative,subject flight cancellation refund request order mefh writing express deep dissatisfaction disappointment regard recent experience booking make platformon august flight schedule vancouver toronto lynx air depart pm unfortunately attempt check flight status lynx air website shock discover flight canceledimmediately contact customer service phone endure extend waiting period could speak representative finally get inform flight rebooke email send notify travel document however upon arrive airport flight informed airlines counter name register flight booking nameto rectify situation airline representative contact gotogate behalf confirm would take three day investigate matter unfortunately available flight day choice purchase new ticket incur substantial financial loss cause significant inconvenience

NEVER NEVER USE THIS SERVICE. THE GOVERNMENT WHO CLAIMS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS SHOULD SHUT THESE GUYS DOWN. I am going on 3 weeks to resolve a name change that I notified them of 15 minutes after I submitted it. They explained they had to contact the airline to do the name change. I did not wait and contacted the airline to confirm this and they said same thing that the 3rd party would have to contact them. So I waited. 1 week later they call me to tell me cancelling and rebooking is the only and best option is what the airline told them. So I contacted airline again and they said that is not true they would not give that information. So I called them back again they escalated it and 1 week goes by again and they tell me again the air line is telling them cancelling it is easier. I call airline again and they said again this is not possible and they also confirmed they had not even heard from the company. Now I am back to waiting for both the airline trying everything they can to help and the 3rd party Go To Gate who escalated it again to get back to me.

"I booked a flight with them, and I also bought the extra option to get the flight refunded for any reason (which I paid an extra 200$ for).After a month, I had to cancel the flight for personal reasons, so I contacted the assistance.Now…Initially the guy said “sorry we can’t refund you anything because that’s what the airline says”, which at that point I go: “sorry but it doesn’t make any sense. I paid the extra price to make sure I could cancel the flight in case I suddenly couldn’t go on the trip”. So then he says “yes sure, since you bought that extra option, you’ll get the full price of the ticket but not the price of the option to get a refund (the 200$ I mentioned)” which okay, I read it wouldn’t get refunded, and I would have preferred to lose 200$ instead of 800$, so I didn’t have an issue with that.Fast forward to a week later, I see a refund of 45$ in my account from the airline. I contact the assistance, and they tell me “sorry we can’t do anything. That’s what the airline policy says”.Turns out that they basically just ask for a refund on the airline site instead of you…all for the wonderful starting price of 200$. Idk if they send a golden flying pigeon with a hand written letter in order to request the refund, but this is a very sad strategy from them in order to make more money.

"I am not one to normally complain , however  I would strongly urge any customer NOT to book through this travel agency. I had booked 3 return tickets to travel to India through Booking .com. Booking.com use this travel agency  as an intermediary to manage their flight bookings. After paying nearly 2900 pounds  for 3 return tickets via BA, and PAID baggage allowance of 23kg per passenger  ,for both the forward and return journey we found  that when  received the tickets from BA a day before travel , the tickets had 23 kg x 2 = 46kg check in baggage for each passenger and NO check in baggage on return. We have contacted BA and were informed that the travel agency has informed them this was the case for our travel, despite our tickets both from Booking.com and travel documents issued by this agency at the time of booking , clearly stating that baggage allowance included with return journey   I am appalled with the service as despite repeated communications to them via email and phone calls , there has been no resolution. The customer services on the other hand have behaved very dismissively to us , and have been looking into this for the past 3 weeks depsite repeated attempts to raise this issue with them, there has been no communication/ resolution. Now with return travel 24 hours away , I have had to pay an additional 240 Euros for baggaage allowance to return to the UK and in addition Pay for seat reservation. I am not one to complain  , but I would warn anyone booking their travel to be wary of this company. please check when you book flights via booking.com that the intermediary is not gotogate, I would strongly urge you to book your tickets directly with the Airlines.

"BOOK FLIGHTS DIRECTLY WITH AIRLINES AND AVOID TRAVEL AGENTS LIKE THIS ONE. IF YOU DO USE THIS OR ANOTHER TRAVEL AGENT THEN PAY WITH A CREDIT CARD. THE CREDIT CARD COMPANY WILL THEN INVESTIGATE ISSUES. YOU WILL THANK ME LATER!During Covid I realised that no matter the price, it was always best to book flights directly with the airline so that changes could be made quickly/efficiently.This time, I booked a return ticket from India to UK on Virgin using Go To Gate because the price was so cheap and I did not check reviews (my mistake!). I paid £672.99 by credit card.One week before the first flight, one of the Virgin flights was cancelled. This was not the fault of G2G. I believe everything would have been fine had the Virgin flight not been cancelled.I tried to reschedule the flight but after a number of calls to G2G, being on hold, getting ""disconnected"", being transferred to various ""departments"", I asked for a refund.10 days later I got a refund of £648.29, which was £24.70 less than I paid. I asked why this was and all G2G said was this was the refund they got from Virgin and for me to contact Virgin! Why should I do that?! I booked with G2G so surely they can tell me why I paid £672.99 but only got refunded £648.29.I asked for a refund invoice so I could see where the missing £24.70 had gone but no response. I have asked my credit card company to investigate.Compared to the unfortunate experience of others, I suppose I should be happy that I got most of my money back pretty quickly. However I am not happy about the missing £24.70 which G2G can't explain to me.I can guess that below, Go To Gate will respond with the standard copy paste about them wanting to help in future. I don't think so. I repeat:BOOK FLIGHTS DIRECTLY WITH AIRLINES AND AVOID TRAVEL AGENTS LIKE THIS ONE. IF YOU DO USE THIS OR ANOTHER TRAVEL AGENT THEN PAY WITH A CREDIT CARD. THE CREDIT CARD COMPANY WILL THEN INVESTIGATE ISSUES. YOU WILL THANK ME LATER!Update 16 August 2023: As expected, GTG copy pasted their standard reply.

"My experience with Gotogate, a partner of Booking.com in Australia, has been nothing short of a frustrating journey. It all began when my booked flight, managed by Gotogate, was unexpectedly cancelled by the airline. I opted for a refund as per their provided options, but little did I know the ordeal that awaited me.From the start, communication with Gotogate was inconsistent and often vague. Despite my inquiries, I received generic responses that lacked specific details about the refund process. As the days turned into weeks, and the weeks into months, my frustration grew as I remained in the dark about the status of my refund.The lack of transparency and clear updates only added to my disappointment. I had expected Gotogate to be a reliable intermediary, but their handling of the refund process fell far short of my expectations. It left me feeling helpless and uncertain about when or if I would receive my hard-earned money back.As the delay continued, it caused significant financial strain. I had budgeted for the trip, and the prolonged wait for the refund left me scrambling to cover unexpected expenses. This added stress only exacerbated my feelings of frustration and disappointment.Attempts to escalate the matter and seek assistance from higher authorities yielded little results. It felt like my concerns were falling on deaf ears, and Gotogate's customer service appeared ill-equipped to handle the situation appropriately.In the end, the experience has left me feeling let down and upset. I had trusted Gotogate to handle my travel plans professionally, but their inability to follow proper procedures with the airline has shattered that trust completely.Overall, the entire process with Gotogate and SriLankan Airlines has been disheartening and emotionally draining.

So 7 hours prior to departure I started calling customer service asking them what was happening and I was repeatedly promised to not worry over the phone by CS that they will be sending me the boarding pass by email prior to departure.The boarding pass never arrived, and at no stage I was informed that the go to gate team was unable to do it for me. Now, 3 weeks later they tell me they are not allowed to do it for their customers!!!So I purchased a faulty product that included a free check-in and I had to pay for their mistakes and lies over the phone. And they refuse to refund me for a service they did not provide and I had to pay otherwise I could not fly. The check-in was never free, as they also told only today me that they are actually aware Ryanair doesn't allow these third-party tickets to be retrieved by customers and we should have paid the check-in service at go to gate in advance for them to send us the tickets!!!At no stage, I was told prior to departure that I had to pay a fee to be sent the boarding passes.You better refund me the money i had to pay or you are proof that you are just here to scam customers.",1,Negative,nearly month go back forth customer service find even purchase ticket free checkin guarantee free kind scam pay ryanair counter ticket impossible generate go gate website booking reference block ryanair app recognize booking make third party hour prior departure start call customer service ask happen repeatedly promise worry phone cs send board pass email prior departurethe boarding pass never arrive stage inform go gate team unable week later tell allow customersso purchase faulty product include free checkin pay mistake lie phone refuse refund service provide pay otherwise could fly checkin never free also tell today actually aware ryanair do not allow thirdparty ticket retrieve customer pay checkin service go gate advance send we ticketsat stage tell prior departure pay fee send boarding passesyou well refund money pay proof scam customer

"This is the most crazy sophisticated scam travel agency I’ve ever experienced. Booked a flight with them and just with an hour 30 mins in Frankfurt. Everything seems okay until when it was time to check in with the airline. They never provided enough time to check in and this was only available a day before my flight. Tried checking in and only to be informed that I needed a transit visa for Germany. I asked and queried the office saying why would I need a transit visa when we ain’t leaving the airport, they were laughing and making jest and some of their agents even mentioned they are operating from the Pacific Ocean. Not realising how painful this is and the reason for the holiday which was to visit my mums graveyard since she passed on in February and couldn’t attend. I spoke with the German embassy and they weren’t helpful as well. I even asked if they offer like an ETA since it’s too late to apply for any visa from their consulate but they didn’t offer support. I would be taking this up with them and report this scam firm to the authorities here in the uk. I don’t know why they are still allowed to conduct operations despite the horrible experiences from people. Would share this on every social media platform to advise people against this scam and ensure their operations in the uk is completely grounded.

"Giving this gotogate.com an automatic one star is unfair to a consumer like myself that was ripped off by this crooked ""travel booking"" company owned by flight center toronto I believe. Booked a flight through them because we wanted to support an African airline Rwandan airlines who is also terrible now based on my recent interactions with them. Booked à flight, there was an issue with one connection. Called a day before to let them know. The agent I spoke to said to me, oh you we can't really do anything till you have actually missed the flight. I said really? He said I had to call after the flight had departed then they could reschedule me. TOTAL LIE, because I called them again the next day before the flight left to tell them that I had bought a whole new flight at à premium cost to get to jfk , and from jfk I thought I could get to dulles which was my departure airport. I got to jfk with jetblue at about 330am. Before clearing customs e.t.c it was about 430am. My flight from dulles was leaving dulles at 1110am. The only flight from jfk to Washington was to regan international which is still 35m from dulles. So go rent à car, to drive 4 1/2 hrs. Called gotogate.com again, to inform them that It's likely I won't make it to dulles before the 3hr checking for international flights requirement. Was ready to leave the airport in the rental, and I saw on the departure board that there was a flight from jfk to the same place I was supposed to fly to from Washington with the same airline. So I called gotogate.com again told them and offered to even pay the difference in price which was showing on line as 300+ usd. The agent said, go talk to qatar airlines and explain everything to them. I said why can't you do it, she said because you are already there and only the airline can do it. My flight was by Rwanda airlines but qatar airlines there partner was doing the first half of the flight. So to me it was straight forward, atleast I thought. Decided not to risk my life driving in the middle of the night, tired and I didn’t know which way, was just going to be at the mercy of g.p.s. Qatar airlines was not opening their jfk counter till 7, so I hoped for the best, returned the rental with a charge, and went to wait by qatar airlines counter at jfk.Qatar airlines opens and they said. ""Oh we don’t sell tickets or do ticket changes here. Your agent gotogate.com should know that. Then I realized what they where doing they were sending all over the place so they could steak my money. I called them back again, by this time I had spoken to them often had to be on hold, keep in mind it is long distance. I called them back again the 11th time, told them what qatar airlines said and the agent said oh how can I help you, I said can you check the notes on my account,  she said there were no notes. I said what, no notes?. She said call Rwanda airlines. ( Anyone reading this should try calling that terrible airline) and see. They have no international number, the number they have listed never has anyone answer. I called back gotogate.com again and now I was kept on hold for 29mins. Then the person came on and said oh sorry we won't refund you because you missed your flight.Ref: MCPYZB as requested.These guys believe they can keep getting away with stealing from people.

"I booked a return flight to Goa from London with this intermediary company GoToGate, via Booking.com. They are a terrible company to deal with and have given me conflicting information about cancellation fees. All of their messages which are sent in reply to queries made via Booking.com are automated, i.e. generated by a machine (probably Chat-GPT). They confirmed this in a phone call when they explained why their messages was saying the cancellation fee is £150 per passenger, yet on the phone it is £300 per passenger. Then, most recently, they have told me it is £350 per passenger, after the customer rep spoke to a 'supervisor'. This is despite, when looking at Air India's fare rules, it saying that the fee is £150 per passenger and the same being confirmed when I spoke with an Air India customer rep on the phone (I also recorded the phone call so I have the evidence).I wish I had booked direct with the airline, Air India. I will NEVER use GoToGate again. It is not worth a small discount in the fare. Book DIRECT with the airline.

"A conclusion for those not wanting to read a long review:) look at Gotogate’s Trustpilot ranking, if I had done so I wouldn’t have used their service.My experience:The company’s online chat representative was not able to provide answers to questions that should have been within the realm of his knowledge and the answers he was able to provide have been in direct contradiction with the information provided by gotogate’s website- the representative did not address that contradiction and sent me to telephone customer support for which I waited for 30 minutes before being disconnected and am now waiting for again.Update: After an extra hour and a half wait on the telephone I had a similar experience with a telephone representative that was both unable to answer basic questions with regards to my journey (such as what happens if the first flight in a single journey ticket is delayed and a thus a connecting flight is missed) as well as letting me know that I have 2 hours to cancel instead of the 24 hours the website clearly stated and if I cancel within 2 hours it will be for a (USD 90) fee not stated in the 24 hour cancellation that the website clearly claimed I have- the representative’s reply to the blatant disregard of company policy is that the airlines do not allow this and she cannot do anything about it.* I requested to talk to a supervisor and such have been told one will get back to me within 24 hours. After talking to the airline I received information that is mostly reassuring.I have read gotogate reply and although polite it does not change my experience. I wouldn’t have been able to cancel my flight and get answers in the time allowed for cancelling but the false advertising of a 24 hour cancellation policy and the time it takes to contact representatives (and them being without the knowledge required) will keep me away from using this platform again - it doesn’t provide the peace of mind that is essential to making travel plans and for travel in general.",1,Negative,conclusion want read long review look gotogate trustpilot ranking do would not use servicemy experiencethe company online chat representative able provide answer question within realm knowledge answer able provide direct contradiction information provide gotogate website representative address contradiction send telephone customer support wait minute disconnect wait againupdate extra hour half wait telephone similar experience telephone representative unable answer basic question regard journey happen first flight single journey ticket delay thus connect flight miss well let know hour cancel instead hour website clearly state cancel within hour usd fee state hour cancellation website clearly claim representative reply blatant disregard company policy airline allow anything request talk supervisor tell one get back within hour talk airline receive information mostly reassuringi read gotogate reply although polite change experience would not able cancel flight get answer time allow cancel false advertising hour cancellation policy time take contact representative without knowledge require keep away use platform do not provide peace mind essential make travel plan travel general
"TWO LONG HAUL TICKETS' VALUE LOST, GOTOGATE OFFERS NO SOLUTION, HIDES FROM COMMUNICATIONWe bought two tickets for a flight Brussels-Madrid-Sao Paulo-Rio De Janeiro.One ticket for a child, one for an adult.The flight Brussels-Madrid was rescheduled for the adult, not for the child. So the child would have to travel alone, which is not possible.Then the booking for the adult was completely lost. Since the child cannot travel alone, this renders both tickets unusable.Gotogate does not reply to emails properly. Their response consists of ‘we need permission to process your details’, then ‘we need your booking details’ (which you already provided, of course), then ‘we need the airline’s permission to alter your flight’ etc. It goes on and on like that. Then no solution in the end.When calling, be prepared to wait forever: first 45 minutes wait to talk to someone, then this person says 'I have to ask my supervisor' for which you're put on hold again for an hour, then the supervisor comes on the phone and puts you on hold again for 45 minutes etc. The result: several calls of 4-5 hours length (!!!!) and no solution. Mind you, these are international calls to Finland, with the appropriate price tag. In the end they just put you on hold forever (more than 2 hours on hold) until you give up and hang up the phone. Or they disconnect the line. Their way of solving problems...Last episode in this soap: an email from Gotogate that they solved the problem by rebooking the flight for the adult… departing 8 months later, from Stockholm instead of Brussels! Can you believe this? The mail ended with the question if we needed any further support…@Gotogate: I’m providing you with the booking details and the email address used for the creation of the booking in the private comment section, so don’t come with the excuse that you can’t do anything because you lack these.

"Terrible experience with support. I was trying to change flights that I’ve booked with flexible fare. I’ve paid extra for this and when trying to contact them they didn’t seem to understand what to do and how to help, there was so much back and forth and I ended up missing the flight and loosing the money. They’ve called a day after the flight’s date saying that if I’d like to change I had to pay airline’s fees (which is completely fair) but at that point there was nothing to be done anymore as the flight it was a no show, and due to medical condition the passenger couldn’t board. The back and forth was endless, I kept receiving calls that sometimes I couldn’t pick up followed up by emails saying that they’ve closed my case and if I would like to continue with it I must call them, so I was calling endlessly waiting 30/40min to always get the following answer “we can’t help you over the phone you must wait us to call you.” And then it took like 24/48h to call me, until it was too late for a resolution. I don’t recommend this company as per their lack of support. Waste of time, money and unprepared people that doesn’t know what to do within the deadlines.

"I recently booked a flight through Gotogate.co.uk in partnership with Booking.com (Booking Order number: 40-381575513) for a trip on 1st July. However, my experience with this company has been nothing short of a nightmare.From the moment I made the booking until the day of the flight, I attempted to make changes by contacting Gotogate customer care more than 20 times. Shockingly, they were utterly unhelpful and simply advised me to contact Qatar Airways. But even Qatar Airways couldn't make any changes because Gotogate.co.uk had booked my flight with a promotional fare.Frustrated, I decided to cancel the flight and contacted customer care to inquire about the penalty for cancellation. Initially, I was informed that the penalty would be £58. However, just two days before the flight, when I called to confirm the cancellation penalty, I was informed that it would be £109. But to my astonishment, when I actually canceled the flight prior to departure, they charged me a whopping £189. When I questioned them about this sudden increase, they casually mentioned that the fee was higher because I cancelled within 3 hours of departure. This information was never conveyed to me beforehand. Instead, I was assured that the penalty would be £109 regardless of the timing of cancellation.I attempted to escalate the issue by contacting the higher authorities and requested to listen to the audio recordings of our previous conversations, but I received no response whatsoever. Now, I am left with no choice but to consider filing a formal complaint with the police if I do not receive a proper response from them. It is alarming how they continue to shift blame onto the airlines for fare increases while their customer care remains utterly helpless.I received an email stating that an airline cancellation fee of GBP 189 per person would be deducted from my refund on Jul 1, 2023, and I am yet to receive any refund from them.In summary, my experience with Gotogate.co.uk has been absolutely horrendous. I strongly advise against using their services or booking through Booking.com. They provide no assistance, mislead customers with incorrect information, and are unresponsive to complaints.

"I have had the worst experience when booking through this agency an international trip (Order M1CHS7)During the last four months, I have called many times and they just don´t care and give a solution to a problem they created themselves.Last January, I bought an international flight itinerary through your agency  with a price over 7000 DKK. The journey was meant to take place in August 2023.In April 2023, I received an email where you notified me that you changed the trip itinerary without my consent. The new itinerary did not fit my plans at all and I requested change. From April 2023 to May 2023 I went through several calls with your customer service, wasting time and energy trying to get you to solve the problem. I was promised many times that you would find a new itinerary that could fit my interest. During this time, you even dared to charge me additional money to change my itinerary.

The solution they give you is to call endlessly until hopefully you find a date that works for you to make the change in terms of economy. But they will only look 3 times per call.

"Order M2X8R21st change on 6th June, found out flight time change by email from the airline, not from flybillet. Duo to this, we no longer could make it to our connecting flight. Contacted flybillet and rebooking was processed. 2nd change on 12th June, found out by logging into the airline’s My Booking page, that our return flights disappeared all together. Contacted flybillet, and they have offered us another rebooking routes, which did not suite us. Requested the previous flights back, only to be told it is not available. (I wonder then, why I could still see them available for purchase elsewhere). Had to agree on another flights back as a result.3rd change on 24th June. Email received from flybillet, informing us that our flights have been cancelled. In the email they have offered us 1 option - to request for refund. As I was not offered an option to rebook, I had no choice but to request for refund, which I did. 2 weeks has passed, not a word from flybillet. I had followed up again via chat today, and was offered an option to rebook. I do not understand anymore what is going on with this company. In the email, I was NOT given an option to rebook. But now they are offering me!? Too late, I want nothing to do with this company and I just want my money back and move on.

Lack of internal alignments (each time you contact them, be aware your call will be passed around with long waiting time, and you will have to explain them your whole story over and over.) and lack of sympathy (we receive no word of apology every time we follow up) amaze me. Cherry on top is that our requested flight for rebooking, still is available for purchases today elsewhere.

Absolutely useless customer service and ridiculous mark up for re booking despite having paid for the flexible ticket option. Wanted to change my flight date due to a family emergency and they asked for an extra £1000 which according to them was just the difference in fare like I said despite having the flexible ticket option. The original price for the flight was way cheaper than that. I also had to call 3 times to get that information and spent around $40 on phone credit calling from Peru. I’d been told the first two calls that there wasn’t anyone in the office that had system access to change my flight. Seriously? To simply change a flight? And that despite calling during UK office hours. Absolute joke.

"Title: Falling Short of Expectations: A Cautionary Tale of Using GoToGateRating: ★☆☆Initially, GoToGate served as a convenient platform for booking airline tickets due to competitive pricing and user-friendly design. However, a recent experience has greatly undermined my confidence in their services.When a friend contracted COVID-19 and was unable to travel, GoToGate's customer service proved to be severely disappointing. Despite the clear impact of the pandemic, the company demonstrated a lack of flexibility and empathy, failing to offer any assistance in adjusting travel plans.After this event, I learned that other users also faced similar challenges.

"Booked a long-awaited holiday to Japan via Booking.com. Before we flew, I checked my documents and became concerned that I didn't have any baggage allowance for the return flight, so I queried this but was reassured that I did indeed have the same allowance for both flights. On booking in for the flight home, we were informed my suspicion had been right, and there was no baggage allowance for the journey. I showed the agent the email conversation where it confirmed we did have it, but obviously they have no power to overrule it so understandably I had to pay for it there and then.Registered a claim shortly after we got home, which was answered very quickly and I was informed that a system error had deleted the baggage allowance from the journey. They requested confirmation of the baggage charge, which I sent in and received a prompt response through GoToGate that they would honour it and credit me shortly. I was very happy with how efficiently this had gone. A couple of weeks later, there was no sign of the refund, so I wrote back to request an update. Then two weeks later. Then a month later.... This has been going on since January and we're now in July! Each and every time I have had a formulaic response just asking me to be patient - well I'm sorry, but my patience is more than used up!

"Avoid at all costs!!!I never dealt with a more unprofessional company.  I booked flexible tickets for a return trip from Dublin to Faro via Lisbon on Air Portugal.  I couldn't use the outward flight but wanted to retain the return flight.  Even with the flexible ticket they cancelled my complete booking with no refund.  When I tried to reschedule the flights to early next year they wouldn't let me, using an excuse that Air Portugal were now using a third party airline for the Lisbon - Faro leg.  Also they won't let you reschedule a flexible ticket on-line you have to phone them.  My opinion is that they train their staff to be deliberately unhelpful and slow to the point that you hang up in frustration.  I repeatedly asked to speak to a Supervisor or Manager and was refused. I will never use GoToGate again under any circumstances.
